# Self-hosting LangSmith with Docker

:::important Enterprise License Required
Self-hosting LangSmith is an add-on to the Enterprise Plan designed for our largest, most security-conscious customers. See our [pricing page](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) for more detail, and contact us at sales@langchain.dev if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.
:::

This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up your environment to run LangSmith locally using Docker. You can do this either by using the LangSmith SDK or by using Docker Compose directly.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```
   If you don't see any server information in the output, make sure Docker is installed correctly and launch the Docker daemon.
2. LangSmith License Key
   1. You can get this from your Langchain representative. Contact us at sales@langchain.dev for more information.
3. SSL(optional)
   1. This should be attachable to a load balancer that will be provisioned by your cloud provider. This will be used for the frontend service.
4. Api Key Salt
   1. This is a secret key that you can generate. It should be a random string of characters.
   2. You can generate this using the following command:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
5. OpenAI API Key(optional).
   1. Used for natural language search feature(beta). Can specify OpenAI key in browser as well for the playground feature.
6. OAuth Configuration(optional).
   1. You can configure oauth using the `.env` file. You will need to provide a `client_id` and `client_issuer_url` for your OAuth provider.
   2. Note, we do rely on the OIDC Authorization Code with PKCE flow. We currently support almost anything that is OIDC compliant however Google does not support this flow.
   3. Without OAuth, you will not be able to create users or organizations.
7. External Postgres(optional).
   1. You can configure external postgres using the `.env` file. You will need to provide connection parameters for your postgres instance.
   2. If using a schema other than public, ensure that you do not have any other schemas with the pgcrypto extension enabled, or you must include that in your search path.
   3. If your password contains special characters, you may need to url encode your password in the connection string.
   4. Note: We do only officially support Postgres versions >= 14.
8. External Redis(optional).
   1. You can configure external redis using the `values.yaml` file. You will need to provide a connection url for your redis instance.
   2. If using TLS, ensure that you use `rediss://` instead of `redis://. E.g "rediss://langsmith-redis:6380/0?password=foo"
   3. We only official support Redis versions >= 6. We also do not support sharded/clustered Redis(though you can point to a single node in a cluster).
9. External ClickHouse(optional).
   1. You can configure external clickhouse using the `.env` file. You will need to provide several connection parameters for your ClickHouse instance.
   2. If using TLS, make sure to set `clickhouse.external.tls` to `true`.
   3. We only officially support ClickHouse versions >= 23. We also only support standalone ClickHouse or ClickHouse Cloud(not clustered or replicated).

## Running via Docker Compose

The following explains how to run the LangSmith using Docker Compose. This is the most flexible way to run LangSmith without Kubernetes. In production, we highly recommend using Kubernetes.

### 1. Fetch the LangSmith `docker-compose.yml` file

You can find the `docker-compose.yml` file and related files in the LangSmith SDK repository here: [<u>LangSmith Docker Compose File</u>](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/blob/main/python/langsmith/cli/docker-compose.yaml)

Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file and all files in that directory from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory.

- Ensure that you copy the `users.xml` file as well.

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` file from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory and rename it to `.env`. Then, set the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Don't change this file. Instead, copy it to .env and change the values there. The default values will work out of the box as long as you provide your license key.
_LANGSMITH_IMAGE_VERSION=0.5.0
LANGSMITH_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key # Change to your Langsmith license key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key # Needed for Online Evals and Magic Query features
AUTH_TYPE=none # Set to oauth if you want to use OAuth2.0
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id # Required if AUTH_TYPE=oauth
OAUTH_ISSUER_URL=https://your-issuer-url # Required if AUTH_TYPE=oauth
API_KEY_SALT=super # Change to your desired API key salt. Can be any random value. Must be set if AUTH_TYPE=oauth
POSTGRES_DATABASE_URI=postgres:postgres@langchain-db:5432/postgres # Change to your database URI if using external postgres. Otherwise, leave it as is
REDIS_DATABASE_URI=redis://langchain-redis:6379 # Change to your Redis URI if using external Redis. Otherwise, leave it as is
LOG_LEVEL=warning # Change to your desired log level
MAX_ASYNC_JOBS_PER_WORKER=10 # Change to your desired maximum async jobs per worker. We recommend 10/suggest spinning up more replicas of the queue worker if you need more throughput
ASYNCPG_POOL_MAX_SIZE=3 # Change the PG pool size based off your pg instance/requirements.
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=langchain-clickhouse # Change to your Clickhouse host if using external Clickhouse. Otherwise, leave it as is
CLICKHOUSE_USER=default # Change to your Clickhouse user if needed
CLICKHOUSE_DB=default # Change to your Clickhouse database if needed
CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123 # Change to your Clickhouse port if needed
CLICKHOUSE_TLS=false # Change to true if you are using TLS to connect to Clickhouse. Otherwise, leave it as is
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=password # Change to your Clickhouse password if needed
CLICKHOUSE_NATIVE_PORT=9000 # Change to your Clickhouse native port if needed
```

You can also set these environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file directly or export them in your terminal. We recommend setting them in the `.env` file.

### 2. Start server

Start the LangSmith application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can also run the server in the background by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If the server starts correctly, it will open up the UI in your browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost/).

The LangSmith UI should be visible/operational and look like this:

![./static/langsmith_ui.png](../static/langsmith_ui.png)

### Stopping the server

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Checking the logs

If, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

## Running via the LangSmith SDK

The following explains how to run the LangSmith using the LangSmith SDK. This is a convenient wrapper around the `docker-compose` command.
We recommend only using this in a local setting as it is not as flexible as using `docker-compose` directly.

### 1. Install the LangSmith SDK

The Python LangSmith SDKs exposes a `langsmith` command line tool.

First, install a recent version of the `langsmith` package:

- Python/Pip: `pip install -U langsmith`

This will install the LangSmith Client and the bundled command line tool.

### 2. Start server

Start the LangSmith tracing server by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
langsmith start --langsmith-license-key=<YOUR_LANGSMITH_LICENSE_KEY> --version=<LANGSMITH_VERSION> --openai-api-key=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

If the server starts correctly, it will open up the UI in your browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost).

The LangSmith UI should be visible/operational and look like this:

![./static/langsmith_ui.png](../static/langsmith_ui.png)

### Stopping the server

To stop the server, run the following command:

```bash
langsmith stop
```

### Checking the logs

If, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run

```bash
langsmith logs
```

## Using LangSmith

Now that LangSmith is running, you can start using it to trace your code. You can find more information on how to use self-hosted LangSmith in the [Self-Hosted Usage Guide](/self_hosting/usage).
