# Self-hosting LangSmith with Docker

:::important Enterprise License Required
Self-hosting LangSmith is an add-on to the Enterprise Plan designed for our largest, most security-conscious customers. See our [pricing page](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) for more detail, and contact us at sales@langchain.dev if you want to get a license key to trial LangSmith in your environment.
:::

This guide provides instructions for installing and setting up your environment to run LangSmith locally using Docker. You can do this either by using the LangSmith SDK or by using Docker Compose directly.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can verify this by running:
   ```bash
   docker info
   ```
   If you don't see any server information in the output, make sure Docker is installed correctly and launch the Docker daemon.
1. LangSmith License Key
   1. You can get this from your Langchain representative. Contact us at sales@langchain.dev for more information.
1. Api Key Salt
   1. This is a secret key that you can generate. It should be a random string of characters.
   1. You can generate this using the following command:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
1. Configuration
1. There are several configuration options that you can set in the `.env` file. You can find more information on the available configuration options in the [Configuration](/self_hosting/installation/configuration) section.

## Running via Docker Compose

The following explains how to run the LangSmith using Docker Compose. This is the most flexible way to run LangSmith without Kubernetes. In production, we highly recommend using Kubernetes.

### 1. Fetch the LangSmith `docker-compose.yml` file

You can find the `docker-compose.yml` file and related files in the LangSmith SDK repository here: [<u>LangSmith Docker Compose File</u>](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/blob/main/python/langsmith/cli/docker-compose.yaml)

Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file and all files in that directory from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory.

- Ensure that you copy the `users.xml` file as well.

### 2. Configure environment variables

1. Copy the `.env.example` file from the LangSmith SDK to your project directory and rename it to `.env`. Then, set the following environment variables in the `.env` file:
1. Configure the appropriate values in the `.env` file. You can find the available configuration options in the [Configuration](/self_hosting/installation/configuration) section.

You can also set these environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file directly or export them in your terminal. We recommend setting them in the `.env` file.

### 2. Start server

Start the LangSmith application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You can also run the server in the background by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

If the server starts correctly, it will open up the UI in your browser at [http://localhost](http://localhost/).

The LangSmith UI should be visible/operational and look like this:

### Stopping the server

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Validate your deployment:

1. Curl the exposed port of the `cli-langchain-frontend-1` container:

   ```bash
   curl localhost:80/info
   {"version":"0.5.7","license_expiration_time":"2033-05-20T20:08:06","batch_ingest_config":{"scale_up_qsize_trigger":1000,"scale_up_nthreads_limit":16,"scale_down_nempty_trigger":4,"size_limit":100,"size_limit_bytes":20971520}}
   ```

1. Visit the exposed port of the `cli-langchain-frontend-1` container on your browser

   The Langsmith UI should be visible/operational

### Checking the logs

If, at any point, you want to check if the server is running and see the logs, run

```bash
docker-compose logs
```
