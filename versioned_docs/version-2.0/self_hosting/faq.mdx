# Frequently Asked Questions:

#### _How does load balancing/ingress work_?

- You will need to expose the frontend container/service to your applications/users. This will handle routing to all downstream services.
- You will need to terminate SSL at the ingress level. We recommend using a managed service like AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, or Nginx.

#### _How can we authenticate to the application?_

- Currently, our self-hosted solution supports SSO with OAuth2.0 and OIDC as an authn solution. Note, we do offer a no-auth solution but highly recommend setting up oauth before moving into production.

You can find more information on setting up SSO in the [configuration section.](./self_hosting/configuration/sso)

#### _Can I use external storage services?_

- You can configure LangSmith to use external versions of all storage services. In a production setting, we strongly recommend using external storage services. Check out the [configuration section](./self_hosting/configuration) for more information.

#### _Does my application need egress to function properly?_

Our deployment only needs egress for a few things:

- Fetching images (If mirroring your images, this may not be needed)
- Talking to any LLMs
- Talking to any external storage services you may have configured
- Fetching OAuth information

Your VPC can set up rules to limit any other access. Note: We require the `X-Tenant-Id` header to be allowed to be passed through to the backend service. This is used to determine which tenant the request is for.

#### _Resource requirements for the application?_

- In kubernetes, we recommend a minimum helm configuration which can be found in [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/examples/medium_size.yaml). For docker, we recommend a minimum of 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs.
- For Postgres, we recommend a minimum of 8GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
- For Redis, we recommend 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
- For Clickhouse, we recommend 32GB of RAM and 8 CPUs.
