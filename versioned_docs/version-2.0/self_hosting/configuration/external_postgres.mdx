# Connect to an External Postgres Database

LangSmith uses a Postgres database as the primary data store for transactional workloads and operational data (almost everything besides runs). By default, LangSmith Self-Hosted will use an internal Postgres database.
However, you can configure LangSmith to use an external Postgres database (*strongly recommended in a production setting*). By configuring an external Postgres database, you can more easily manage backups, scaling, and other operational tasks for your database.

## Requirements

- A provisioned Postgres database that your LangSmith instance will have network access to. We recommend using a managed Postgres service like:
  - [Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html)
  - [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/curated-resources/cloud-sql#section-1)
  - [Azure Database for PostgreSQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql#features)
- Note: We only officially support Postgres versions >= 14.
- A user with admin access to the Postgres database. This user will be used to create the necessary tables, indexes, and schemas.
- This user will also need to have the ability to create extensions in the database. We use/will try to install the btree_gin, btree_gist, pgcrypto, citext, and pg_trgm extensions.
- If using a schema other than public, ensure that you do not have any other schemas with the extensions enabled, or you must include that in your search path.

## Connection String

You will need to provide a connection string to your Postgres database. This connection string should include the following information:

- Host
- Port
- Database
- Username
- Password(Make sure to url encode this if there are any special characters)
- URL params

This will take the form of:

```
username:password@host:port/database?<url_params>
```

An example connection string might look like:

```
myuser:mypassword@myhost:5432/mydatabase?sslmode=disable
```

Without url parameters, the connection string would look like:

```
myuser:mypassword@myhost:5432/mydatabase
```

## Configuration

With your connection string in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use an external Postgres database. You can do this by modifying the `values` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the `.env` file for your Docker installation.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    HelmBlock(`
  postgres:
    external:
      enabled: true
      connectionUrl: "Your connection url"
    `),
    DockerBlock(
      `# In your .env file
POSTGRES_DATABASE_URI="Your connection url"
    `
    ),
  ]}
/>

Once configured, you should be able to reinstall your LangSmith instance. If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be using your external Postgres database.
