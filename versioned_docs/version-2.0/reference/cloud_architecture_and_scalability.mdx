# Cloud architecture and scalability

:::note Cloud-managed solution
This section is only relevant for the cloud-managed LangSmith services available at https://smith.langchain.com and https://eu.smith.langchain.com.

For information on the self-hosted LangSmith solution, please refer to the [self-hosted documentation](../self_hosting/).
:::

LangSmith is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is designed to be highly scalable. Many customers run production workloads on LangSmith for both LLM application observability and evaluation.

## Architecture

The US-based LangSmith service is deployed in the `us-central1` (Iowa) region of GCP.

**NOTE:** The [EU-based LangSmith service](https://eu.smith.langchain.com) is now available (as of mid-July 2024) and is deployed in the `europe-west4` (Netherlands) region of GCP. If you are interested in this, please contact us at sales@langchain.dev.

### Regional services

Cloud-managed LangSmith uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication/authorization and [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/cloud) for data warehouse.

#### Regions FAQ

Current region: <RegionalUrl />

#### _Are there any functional differences between US and EU cloud-managed LangSmith_?

There may be a small delay between launches to each region depending on the feature.
Besides that, they are functionally equivalent - all features supported in the US are supported in the EU.

#### _Can an organization have workspaces in different regions_?

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact support@langchain.dev and share your use case.

#### _Can I connect an EU organization to a US organization and share billing_?

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact support@langchain.dev and share your use case.

### GCP services

LangSmith is composed of the following services, all deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

- LangSmith Frontend: serves the LangSmith UI.
- LangSmith Backend: serves the LangSmith API.
- LangSmith Platform Backend: handles authentication and other high-volume tasks. (Internal service)
- LangSmith Playground: handles forwarding requests to various LLM providers for the Playground feature.
- LangSmith Queue: handles processing of asynchronous tasks. (Internal service)

LangSmith uses the following GCP storage services:

- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for runs inputs and outputs.
- Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for transactional workloads.
- Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis for queuing and caching.
- Clickhouse Cloud on GCP for trace ingestion and analytics. Our services connect to Clickhouse Cloud, which is hosted in the same GCP region, via a private endpoint.

Some additional GCP services we use include:

- Google Cloud Load Balancer for routing traffic to the LangSmith services.
- Google Cloud CDN for caching static assets.
- Google Cloud Armor for security and rate limits. For more information on rate limits we enforce, please refer to [this guide](../concepts/usage_and_billing/rate_limits).

## Scalability

LangSmith is designed to be scalable and performant.

As of load testing done in February 2024, LangSmith can comfortably process 500K+ runs (spans) per minute.
We anticipate that LangSmith can process 750K+ runs per minute with the optimizations we've made since then.
