# Trace with `LangGraph` (Python and JS/TS)

LangSmith smoothly integrates with LangGraph ([Python](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) and [JS](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/))
to help you trace agentic workflows, whether you're using [LangChain modules](./trace_with_langchain) or [other SDKs](./annotate_code#use-traceable--traceable).

## With LangChain

If you are using LangChain modules within LangGraph, you only need to set a few environment variables to enable tracing.

This guide will walk through a basic example. For more detailed information on configuration, see the [Trace With LangChain](./trace_with_langchain) guide.

### 0. Installation

Install the LangGraph library and the OpenAI integration for Python and JS (we use the OpenAI integration for the code snippets below).

For a full list of packages available, see the [LangChain Python docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/) and [LangChain JS docs](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/platforms/).

<LangGraphInstallationCodeTabs />

### 1. Configure your environment

<ConfigureSDKEnvironmentCodeTabs />

### 2. Log a trace

Once you've set up your environment, you can call LangChain runnables as normal.
LangSmith will infer the proper tracing config:

<LangGraphQuickStartCodeTabs />

An example trace from running the above code [looks like this](https://smith.langchain.com/public/10863294-ee79-484a-927f-0558230f1547/r).

## Without LangChain

If you are using other SDKs or custom functions within LangGraph, you will need to [wrap or decorate them appropriately](./annotate_code#use-traceable--traceable)
(with the `@traceable` decorator in Python or the `traceable` function in JS, or something like e.g. `wrap_openai` for SDKs).
If you do so, LangSmith will automatically nest traces from those wrapped methods.

Here's an example. You can also see this page for more information.

### 0. Installation

Install the LangGraph library and the OpenAI SDK for Python and JS (we use the OpenAI integration for the code snippets below).

<LangGraphWithoutLangChainInstallationCodeTabs />

### 1. Configure your environment

<ConfigureSDKEnvironmentCodeTabs />

### 2. Log a trace

Once you've set up your environment, [wrap or decorate the custom functions/SDKs](./annotate_code#use-traceable--traceable) you want to trace.
LangSmith will then infer the proper tracing config:

<LangGraphWithoutLangChainCodeTabs />

An example trace from running the above code [looks like this](https://smith.langchain.com/public/353f27da-c221-4b67-b9ec-ede3777f3271/r).
