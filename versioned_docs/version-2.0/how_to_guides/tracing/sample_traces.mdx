# Set a sampling rate for traces

:::note
This section is relevant for those using the LangSmith SDK or LangChain, not for those logging directly with the LangSmith API.
:::

By default, all traces are logged to LangSmith.
To down-sample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE` environment variable to
any float between `0` (no traces) and `1` (all traces).
For instance, setting the following environment variable will log 75% of the traces.

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE=0.75
```

This works for the `traceable` decorator and `RunTree` objects.
