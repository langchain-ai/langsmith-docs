# Log custom LLM traces

:::note
Nothing will break if you don't log LLM traces in the correct format and data will still be logged. However, the data will not be processed or rendered in a way that is specific to LLMs.
:::

The best way to logs traces from OpenAI models is to use the [wrapper](./annotate_code#wrap-the-openai-client) available in the `langsmith` SDK for Python and TypeScript. However, you can also log traces from custom models by following the guidelines below.

LangSmith provides special rendering and processing for LLM traces, including token counting (assuming token counts are not available from the model provider) and token-based cost calculation.
In order to make the most of this feature, you must log your LLM traces in a specific format.

:::note

The examples below uses the `traceable` decorator/wrapper to log the model run (which is the recommended approach for Python and JS/TS). However, the same idea applies if you are using the [RunTree](./annotate_code#use-the-runtree-api) or <RegionalUrl type='api' suffix='/redoc' text='API' /> directly.

## Chat-style models

For chat-style models, inputs must be a list of messages in OpenAI-compatible format, represented as Python dictionaries or TypeScript object. Each message must contain the key `role` and `content`.

The output is accepted in any of the following formats:

- A dictionary/object that contains the key `choices` with a value that is a list of dictionaries/objects. Each dictionary/object must contain the key `message`, which maps to a message object with the keys `role` and `content`.
- A dictionary/object that contains the key `message` with a value that is a message object with the keys `role` and `content`.
- A tuple/array of two elements, where the first element is the role and the second element is the content.
- A dictionary/object that contains the key `role` and `content`.

The input to your function should be named `messages`.

You can also provide the following `metadata` fields to help LangSmith identify the model and calculate costs. If using LangChain or [OpenAI wrapper](./annotate_code#wrap-the-openai-client), these fields will be automatically populated correctly. To learn more about how to use the `metadata` fields, see [this guide](./add_metadata_tags).

- `ls_provider`: The provider of the model, eg "openai", "anthropic", etc.
- `ls_model_name`: The name of the model, eg "gpt-3.5-turbo", "claude-3-opus-20240307", etc.

The above code will log the following trace:

## Stream outputs

For streaming, you can "reduce" the outputs into the same format as the non-streaming version. This is currently only supported in Python.

```python
def _reduce_chunks(chunks: list):
    all_text = "".join([chunk["choices"][0]["message"]["content"] for chunk in chunks])
    return {"choices": [{"message": {"content": all_text, "role": "assistant"}}]}

@traceable(
    run_type="llm",
    reduce_fn=_reduce_chunks,
    metadata={"ls_provider": "my_provider", "ls_model_name": "my_model"}
)
def my_streaming_chat_model(messages: list):
    for chunk in ["Hello, " + messages[1]["content"]]:
        yield {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "message": {
                        "content": chunk,
                        "role": "assistant",
                    }
                }
            ]
        }

list(
    my_streaming_chat_model(
        [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Please greet the user."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "polly the parrot"},
        ],
    )
)
```

## Manually provide token counts

By default, LangSmith uses TikToken to count tokens, utilizing a best guess at the model's tokenizer based on the `ls_model_name` provided. Many models already include token counts as part of the response. To send them to LangSmith, you can add a `usage_metadata` key to the function's response, containing a dictionary with the keys `input_tokens`, `output_tokens` and `total_tokens`.
If using LangChain or [OpenAI wrapper](./annotate_code#wrap-the-openai-client), these fields will be automatically populated correctly.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import traceable\n
inputs = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'd like to book a table for two."},
]\n
output = {
    "choices": [
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",

    messages: { role: string; content: string }[];
    model: string;
  }) => {
    return output;
  },
  { run_type: "llm", name: "chat_model", metadata: { ls_provider: "my_provider", ls_model_name: "my_model" } }
);\n
await chatModel({ messages });`),

/>

## Instruct-style models

For instruct-style models (string in, string out), your inputs must contain a key `prompt` with a string value. Other inputs are also permitted. The output must return an object that, when serialized, contains the key `choices` with a list of dictionaries/objects. Each must contain the key `text` with a string value.
The same rules for `metadata` and `usage_metadata` apply as for chat-style models.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`@traceable(
    run_type="llm",
    metadata={"ls_provider": "my_provider", "ls_model_name": "my_model"}
)
def hello_llm(prompt: str):
    return {
        "choices": [
            {"text": "Hello, " + prompt}
        ],
        "usage_metadata": {
            "input_tokens": 4,
            "output_tokens": 5,
            "total_tokens": 9,
        },
    }\n
hello_llm("polly the parrot\\n")`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";\n
const helloLLM = traceable(
  ({ prompt }: { prompt: string }) => {
    return {
      choices: [
        { text: "Hello, " + prompt }
      ],
        usage_metadata: {
            input_tokens: 4,
            output_tokens: 5,
            total_tokens: 9,
        },
    };
  },
  { run_type: "llm", name: "hello_llm", metadata: { ls_provider: "my_provider", ls_model_name: "my_model" } }
);\n
await helloLLM({ prompt: "polly the parrot\\n" });`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

The above code will log the following trace:
