# Optimize tracing spend on LangSmith

This tutorial walks through optimizing your spend on LangSmith. In it, we will analyze our
current usage patterns, configure trace retention to only save important traces for long periods of time,
and set up sane usage limits to avoid accidental cost overruns. 

## Understand your current usage
Before doing any optimization, it is important to understand your existing usage patterns to make sure you
set sane limits. We will do this by accessing our past Invoices and Usage Graph.

### Past Invoices
First, we can look at past invoices to understand the dollar amount we have spent over time. Go to `Settings` -> `Usage and Billing`
and click on the `Invoices` tab to view 

### Usage Graph
First, we can understand our existing usage trends from the tracing Usage Graphs. Go to `Settings` -> `Usage and Billing`. 
Click on the `Usage Graph` tab, which should show consumption of different billable metrics over time. Traces are billed
through two different metrics: `LangSmith Traces (Base Charge)` and `LangSmith Traces (Extended Data Retention Add-Ons)`.
The former counts **all traces** that are sent to LangSmith, whereas the latter only counts traces that have extended data 
retention.

Check that usage matches your team's expectation. Whether or not this represents future usage depends on your 
team's plans with LangSmith. Are you already in production? Do you have a big release coming up with lots of
expected usage. If the answer to these questions leads you to believe that your usage is stable, you can look 
at the trend of your graph and guess future usage from there.
