# Tracing Overview

Tracing is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of your LLM application.
LangSmith has best-in-class tracing capabilities, regardless of whether or not you are using LangChain.

Tracing can help you track down issues like:
- An unexpected end result
- Why an agent is looping
- Why a chain was slower than expected
- How many tokens an agent used at each step

To get started, check out the [Quick Start Guide](/tracing/quick_start).

After that, peruse the [Concepts Section](/tracing/concepts) to better understand the different components involved with tracing.

If you want to learn how to accomplish a particular task, check out our comprehensive [How-To Guides](/tracing/faq)

For example use cases, check out the [Use Cases](/tracing/use_cases) page.
