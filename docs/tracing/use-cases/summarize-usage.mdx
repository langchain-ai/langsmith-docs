# Generating App Insights

Most usage of LLM applications is in the form of unstructured data. LangChain can be used to
cluster and summarize how people are using an application so you can build a better product.

In this example, you will perform simple k-means clustering and an LLM call to summarize logged user activity.

## Prerequesites

This example assumes you've configured your environment to connect to LangSmith.

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

It also uses OpenAI for the embeddings and Anthropic to run the LLM. You can replace these with your models of choice or
install the following:

```bash
pip install -U langchain openai anthropic
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

## Step 1: Sample recent runs

For this example, we will randomly sample from the past day's runs. You can take a much larger sample,
depending on your needs.

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from langsmith import Client

# Update these values to match your project
# and run schema.
project_name = "my-project"
input_key = "question"
max_to_analyze = 10_000
yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)

client = Client()
runs = list(
    client.list_runs(
        project_name=project_name,
        start_time=yesterday,
        execution_order=1, # Ignore child runs
    )
)

inputs = [str(run.inputs[input_key]) for run in runs if input_key in run.inputs]
sampled = inputs
if len(inputs) > max_to_analyze:
    sampled = random.sample(sampled, max_to_analyze)
```

## Step 2: Embed the inputs for clustering

Embeddings provide vector representations of text that we can use to cluster semantically similar inputs.

```python
import numpy as np
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings()
embeddings = embedder.embed_documents(sampled)
arr = np.stack(embeddings)
```

Now, cluster the embeddings:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Reduce n_clusters in case you're trying this walkthrough out on a small project
n_clusters = min(10, len(sampled)//4)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, n_init='auto', init="k-means++", random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(arr)
```

## Step 3: Summarize each cluster

Now it's time to produce the summaries! We will use Claude-2 using the `ChatAnthropic` model with a 100k token context window.
You can check out the prompt we're using [on the hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/wfh/summarize_logs).

```python
import anthropic
from langchain import hub
from langchain.chat_models import ChatAnthropic
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser


def _truncate_inputs(input_logs: list) -> str:
    max_prompt_tokens = 80_000
    # Truncate to max_prompt_tokens
    tokenizer = anthropic.Anthropic().get_tokenizer()
    inputs = "\n\n".join(input_logs)
    truncated_ids = tokenizer.encode(inputs).ids[:max_prompt_tokens]
    return {
        "logs": tokenizer.decode(truncated_ids)
    }

prompt = hub.pull("wfh/summarize_logs")
chain = (
    _truncate_inputs
    | prompt
    | ChatAnthropic(
        model="claude-2", 
        temperature=1,
        max_tokens_to_sample=1000,
    )
    | StrOutputParser()
)
    
input_arr = np.array(sampled)
batch_inputs = [
    input_arr[kmeans.labels_ == i] for i in range(n_clusters)
]
summaries = chain.batch(batch_inputs, {"max_concurrency": 2})
for summary in summaries:
    print(summary)
```

Congratulations! You have now clustered and summarized user activity for an application.

This is just a simple example of how to use LangChain to analyze your application logs. You will likely 
want to combine this with other techniques, such as [run filtering](./export-runs/local) to select relevant
examples. You can also update the prompt to ask more targed questions or to provide additional context.
