# How to log and view traces to LangSmith

LangSmith makes it easy to log and view traces from your LLM application, regardless of which language or framework you use.

### The `@traceable` decorator

The `@traceable` decorator is a simple way to log traces from the LangSmith Python SDK. Simply decorate any function with `@traceable`, set your
`LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` and `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2='true'`, and the inputs and outputs of that function will be logged to LangSmith as a `Run`. You can [choose
your desination project](/tracing/faq/customizing_trace_attributes#changing-the-destination-project-at-runtime), [add custom metadata and tags](/tracing/faq/customizing_trace_attributes#adding-metadata-and-tags-to-traces),
and [customize your run name](/tracing/faq/customizing_trace_attributes#customizing-the-run-name).

Also available is the `wrap_openai` function. This function allows you to wrap your OpenAI client in order to automatically log traces, no decorator necessary - it
is applied for you, under the hood.

### The `RunTree` API

Another, more explicit way to log traces to LangSmith is via the `RunTree` API. This API allows you more control over your tracing - you can manually
create runs and children runs to craft your trace however you like. You still need to set your `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, but `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` is not
necessary for this method.

### Logging Traces

There are multiple ways to logs traces to LangSmith using the LangSmith SDK or API, OpenAI's Python client, or LangChain.

When using the Python SDK, take special note of the `traceable` decorator and `wrap_openai`, as these methods can be easier to use than the `RunTree` API.

:::note
Please follow the [Setup](/) guide to learn how to sign up and create an API key.
By default, the traces will be logged to a project named `default`.
To log traces to a different project, see [this section](/tracing/faq/customizing_trace_attributes#logging-to-a-specific-project).
:::
:::note
Please make sure to set the `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key before running the examples below.
Additionally, you will need to set `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2='true'` if you plan to use either:

- LangChain (Python or JS)
- `@traceable` decorator or `wrap_openai` method in the Python SDK

### OPTION 1: Use traceable decorator ###
client = openai.Client()
@traceable(run_type="tool", name="Retrieve Context")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    return "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict."\n

    )
    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content\n
chat_pipeline("Can you summarize this morning's meetings?")\n
### Alternatively, use the wrapped OpenAI client to log traces automatically:
client = wrap_openai(openai.Client())
client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}],
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo"

    name="Chat Pipeline Run Tree",

### Viewing Traces

To view traces, navigate to the project details page for your project (by default, all traces are logged to the "default" project).
Then, click on a row in the traces table to expand the trace. This will bring up a run tree, which shows the parent-child relationships between runs, as well as the inputs and outputs of each run.
You can also view feedback, metadata, and other information in the tabs.
![Trace](../static/faq/trace.png)

### Setting a sampling rate for tracing

To downsample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE` environment variable to
any float between 0 (no traces) and 1 (all traces). This requires a python SDK version >= 0.0.84, and a JS SDK version >= 0.0.64.
For instance, setting the following environment variable will filter out 25% of traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE=0.75
```

This works for the `traceable` decorator and `RunTree` objects.

### Distributed Tracing

LangSmith supports distributed tracing out of the box, linking runs within a trace across services using context propagation headers (`langsmith-trace` and optional `baggage` for metadata/tags).

Example client-server setup:

- Trace starts on client
- Continues on server

```python
# client.py
from langsmith.run_helpers import get_current_run_tree, traceable
import httpx

@traceable
async def my_client_function():
    headers = {}
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url="...") as client:
        if run_tree := get_current_run_tree():
            # add langsmith-id to headers
            headers.update(run_tree.to_headers())
        return await client.post("/my-route", headers=headers)
```

Then the server (or other service) can continue the trace by passing the headers in as `langsmith_extra`:

```python
# server.py
from langsmith import traceable
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request


@traceable
async def my_application():
    ...


app = FastAPI()  # Or Flask, Django, or any other framework


@app.post("/my-route")
async def fake_route(request: Request):
    # request.headers:  {"langsmith-trace": "..."}
    # as well as optional metadata/tags in `baggage`
    # highlight-next-line
    return await my_application(langsmith_extra={"parent": request.headers})

```

### Turning off tracing

If you've decided you no longer want to trace your runs, you can remove the environment variables configured to start tracing in the first place.
By unsetting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable, traces will no longer be logged to LangSmith.
Note that this currently does not affect the `RunTree` objects.

This setting works both with LangChain and the LangSmith SDK, in both Python and TypeScript.

### Getting the run ID of a logged run

The example below shows how to get the run ID of a logged run using the LangSmith SDK. **To get the run ID of a run using LangChain, you can follow the guide [here](/tracing/faq/langchain_specific_guides#getting-a-run-id-from-a-langchain-call).**

### Getting the URL of a logged run

Runs are logged to whichever project you have configured ("default" if none is set), and you can view them by opening the corresponding project details page. To programmatically access the run's URL, you can
use the LangSmith client. Below is an example. To get the run ID of a run, you can follow the guide [here](#getting-the-run-id-of-a-logged-run).

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client\n
client = Client()
run = client.read_run("<run_id>")
print(run.url)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client } from "langsmith";\n
const client = new Client();
const runUrl = await client.getRunUrl({runId: "<run_id>"});
console.log(runUrl);
`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

### Deleting traces in a project?

You can delete a project, along with all its associated traces and other information, in the UI or by using the LangSmith client.

Below is an example using the SDK:

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client\n
client = Client()
client.delete_project(project_name="<project_name>")`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client } from "langsmith";\n
const client = new Client();
await client.deleteProject({projectName: "<project_name>"});
`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>
