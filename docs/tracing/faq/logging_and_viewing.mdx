# How to log and view traces to LangSmith

LangSmith makes it easy to log and view traces from your LLM application, regardless of which language or framework you use.

### Logging Traces

There are multiple ways to logs traces to LangSmith using the LangSmith SDK or API, OpenAI's Python client, or LangChain.

When using the Python SDK, take special note of the `traceable` decorator and `wrap_openai`, as these methods can be easier to use than the `RunTree` API.

:::note
Please follow the [Setup](/setup) guide to learn how to sign up and create an API key.
By default, the traces will be logged to a project named `default`.
To log traces to a different project, see [this section](/tracing/faq/customizing_trace_attributes#logging-to-a-specific-project).
:::
:::note
Please make sure to set the `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key before running the examples below.
Additionally, you will need to set `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2='true'` if you plan to use either

- LangChain (Python or JS)
- `@traceable` decorator or `wrap_openai` method in the Python SDK

### Viewing Traces

To view traces, navigate to the project details page for your project (by default, all traces are logged to the "default" project).
Then, click on a row in the traces table to expand the trace. This will bring up a run tree, which shows the parent-child relationships between runs, as well as the inputs and outputs of each run.
You can also view feedback, metadata, and other information in the tabs.
![Trace](../static/faq/trace.png)

### Setting a sampling rate for tracing

To downsample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE` environment variable to
any float between 0 (no traces) and 1 (all traces). This requires a python SDK version >= 0.0.84, and a JS SDK version >= 0.0.64.
For instance, setting the following environment variable will filter out 25% of traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE=0.75
```

This works for the `traceable` decorator and `RunTree` objects.

### Turning off tracing

If you've decided you no longer want to trace your runs, you can remove the environment variables configured to start tracing in the first place.
By unsetting the `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2` environment variable, traces will no longer be logged to LangSmith.
Note that this currently does not affect the `RunTree` objects.

This setting works both with LangChain and the LangSmith SDK, in both Python and TypeScript.

### Getting the run ID of a logged run

The example below shows how to get the run ID of a logged run using the LangSmith SDK. **To get the run ID of a run using LangChain, you can follow the guide [here](/tracing/faq/langchain_specific_guides#getting-a-run-id-from-a-langchain-call).**

### Getting the URL of a logged run

Runs are logged to whichever project you have configured ("default" if none is set), and you can view them by opening the corresponding project details page. To programmatically access the run's URL, you can
use the LangSmith client. Below is an example. To get the run ID of a run, you can follow the guide [here](#getting-the-run-id-of-a-logged-run).

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client\n
client = Client()
run = client.read_run("<run_id>")
print(run.url)`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client } from "langsmith";\n
const client = new Client();
const runUrl = await client.getRunUrl({runId: "<run_id>"});
console.log(runUrl);
`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

### Deleting traces in a project?

You can delete a project, along with all its associated traces and other information, in the UI or by using the LangSmith client.

Below is an example using the SDK:

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith import Client\n
client = Client()
client.delete_project(project_name="<project_name>")`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { Client } from "langsmith";\n
const client = new Client();
await client.deleteProject({projectName: "<project_name>"});
`),
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>
