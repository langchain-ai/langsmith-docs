# Developer Setup

This guide will continue from the hub quickstart, using the Python or TypeScript SDK to interact with the hub instead of the Playground UI.

This guide assumes you've gone through the Hub [Quick Start](./quickstart) including login-required steps.

If you don't yet have an account, you'll only be able to pull public objects.

## 1. Install/upgrade packages

**Note:** You likely need to upgrade even if they're already installed!

<HubInstallationCodeTabs />

## 2. Configuring environment variables

Get an API key for your **Personal** organization if you have not yet. The hub will not work with your non-personal organization's api key!

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY="ls_..."
```

If you already have `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` set to a personal organization’s api key from LangSmith, you can skip this.

## 3. Pull an object from the hub and use it

<HubPullCodeTabs />

## 4. Push a prompt to your personal organization as a private prompt

For this step, you'll need the `handle` for your account!

<HubPushCodeTabs />
