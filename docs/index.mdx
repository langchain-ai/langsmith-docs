# Get started with LangSmith

**LangSmith** is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications.
It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence.
With LangSmith you can:
- **Trace LLM Calls**: Gain visibility into LLM calls, and other parts of your application's logic. 
- **Evaluate Performance**: Compare results across models and prompts to identify what works best.
- **Improve Prompts**: Quickly refine prompts to achieve more accurate and reliable results.

:::tip LangSmith + LangChain OSS

LangSmith integrates seamlessly with LangChain's open source frameworks [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com) and [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/), with no extra instrumentation needed. 

If you're already using either of these, see the how-to guide for [setting up LangSmith with LangChain](./observability/how_to_guides/tracing/trace_with_langchain) or [setting up LangSmith with LangGraph](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/observability/how_to_guides/tracing/trace_with_langgraph). 

:::

LangSmith is a **standalone platform** that can be used on it's own no matter how you're creating your LLM applicatons. 

In this tutorial, we'll walk you though logging your first trace in LangSmith using the LangSmith SDK and running an evaluation to measure the performance of your application. This example uses the OpenAI API, however you can use your provider of choice. 

## 1. Install LangSmith

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "bash",
      content: `pip install -U langsmith openai`,
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "bash",
      content: `yarn add langsmith openai`,
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

## 2. Create an API key

To create an API key head to the <RegionalUrl text='Settings page' suffix='/settings' />. Then click **Create API Key.**

## 3. Set up your environment

<ConfigureSDKEnvironmentCodeTabs />

## 4. Log your first trace

We provide multiple ways to log traces to LangSmith. Below, we'll highlight
how to use `traceable()`. See more on the [Annotate code for tracing](./observability/how_to_guides/tracing/annotate_code) page.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "python",
      content: PythonSDKTracingCode(),
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "typescript",
      content: TypeScriptSDKTracingCode(),
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

Learn more about tracing in the observability [tutorials](./observability/tutorials), [conceptual guide](./observability/concepts) and [how-to guides](./observability/how_to_guides/index.md).

## 5. View your trace

By default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`. You should see the following [sample output trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/b37ca9b1-60cd-4a2a-817e-3c4e4443fdc0/r) logged using the above code. 


## 6. Run your first evaluation

[Evaluations](./evaluation/concepts#evaluators) help assess application performance by testing it against a given set of inputs. Evaluations require a system to test, data to serve as test cases, and optionally evaluators to grade the results. 

Here we are running an evaluation against a sample dataset using a built-in accuracy evaluator for accuracy. 

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    python`
        from langsmith import Client, traceable

        client = Client()

        # Define dataset: these are your test cases
        dataset = client.create_dataset(
            "Sample Dataset",
            description="A sample dataset in LangSmith.",
        )

        client.create_examples(
            inputs=[
                {"postfix": "to LangSmith"},
                {"postfix": "to Evaluations in LangSmith"},
            ],
            outputs=[
                {"response": "Welcome to LangSmith"},
                {"response": "Welcome to Evaluations in LangSmith"},
            ],
            dataset_id=dataset.id,
        )

        # Define an interface to your application (tracing optional)
        @traceable
        def dummy_app(inputs: dict) -> dict:
            return {"response": "Welcome " + inputs["postfix"]}

        # Define your evaluator(s)
        def exact_match(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:
            return outputs["response"] == reference_outputs["response"]

        # Run the evaluation
        experiment_results = client.evaluate(
            dummy_app, # Your AI system goes here
            data=dataset, # The data to predict and grade over
            evaluators=[exact_match], # The evaluators to score the results
            experiment_prefix="sample-experiment", # The name of the experiment
            metadata={"version": "1.0.0", "revision_id": "beta"}, # Metadata about the experiment
            max_concurrency=4,  # Add concurrency.
        )

        # Analyze the results via the UI or programmatically
        # If you have 'pandas' installed you can view the results as a
        # pandas DataFrame by uncommenting below:

        # experiment_results.to_pandas()
