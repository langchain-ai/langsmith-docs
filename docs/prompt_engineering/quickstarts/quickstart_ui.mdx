# Prompt Engineering Quick Start (UI)

This quick start will get you up and running with prompt engineering in LangSmith. We will walk through how
to create, test, and iterate on prompts in LangSmith.

:::info QuickStart
This tutorial uses the UI for prompt engineering, if you are interested in using the SDK instead, read [this guide](./quickstart_sdk).
:::

## 1. Setup

The only setup needed for this guide is to make sure you have signed up for a valid [LangSmith](https://langsmith.com) account.

## 2. Create a prompt

To create a prompt in LangSmith, navigate to the **Prompts** section of the left-hand sidebar and click on the “+ New Prompt” button.
You can then modify the prompt by editing/adding messages and input variables.
Once you have made your desired changes you can click the “Save” button to save your prompt for future use.

## 3. Test a prompt

To test a prompt, simply navigate to the **Playground** in the left-hand sidebar and then open the prompt you wish to test.
After selecting the prompt input the values you want to test over.
If you are interested in testing over a dataset instead of individual examples, check out [this guide](./how_to_guides/playground/testing_over_dataset).

## 4. Iterate on a prompt

LangSmith makes it easy to iterate on prompts with your entire team. Anyone in your workspace can select a prompt to iterate on in the playground and once they are happy with their changes they can simply save it as a new commit.

To learn more about iterating on your prompts in LangSmith, you can read [this guide](../concepts/index#prompt-canvas).

You can also tag specific commits to mark important moments in your commit history:
