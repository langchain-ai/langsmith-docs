# Prompt engineering how-to guides

Step-by-step guides that cover key tasks and operations for doing prompt engineering LangSmith.

## Prompt hub

Organize and manage prompts in LangSmith to streamline your LLM development workflow.

- [Create a prompt](./how_to_guides/prompts/create_a_prompt)
- [Update a prompt](./how_to_guides/prompts/update_a_prompt)
- [Manage prompts programmatically](./how_to_guides/prompts/manage_prompts_programatically)
- [LangChain Hub](./how_to_guides/prompts/langchain_hub)

## Playground

Quickly iterate on prompts and models in the LangSmith Playground.

- [Run the playground against a custom LangServe model server](./how_to_guides/playground/custom_endpoint)
- [Run the playground against an OpenAI-compliant model provider/proxy](./how_to_guides/playground/custom_openai_compliant_model)
- [Use custom TLS certificates](./how_to_guides/playground/custom_tls_certificates)
- [Manage model configurations](./how_to_guides/playground/managing_model_configurations)

## Few shot prompting

Use LangSmith datasets to serve few shot examples to your application

- [Index a dataset for few shot example selection](../../evaluation/how_to_guides/index_datasets_for_dynamic_few_shot_example_selection)
