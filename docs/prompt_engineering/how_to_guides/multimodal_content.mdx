# Include multimodal content

Some applications are based around multimodal content, like a chatbot that can answer questions about a PDF or image.
In these cases, you'll want to include multimodal content in your prompt and test the model's ability to answer questions about the content.

There are two ways to include multimodal content in a prompt:

1. Inline content: Static content included in all prompts
2. Template variables: Creates a template variable for each attachment

## Inline content

Click the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content.
Under the `Upload content` tab, you can upload a file and include it inline in the prompt.

## Template variables

Click the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content.
Under the `Template variables` tab, you can create a template variable for a specific attachment type.
Currently, only images, PDFs, and audio files (.wav, .mp3) are supported.

## Populate the template variable

In the right side of the screen, you'll see a button to add content to populate the template variable.

This is where you can try out different input with your prompt.

## Run an evaluation

After testing out your prompt manually, you can [run an evaluation](../../evaluation/how_to_guides/evaluate_with_attachments?mode=ui) to see how the prompt performs over a golden dataset of information.
