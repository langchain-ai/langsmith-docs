<br />

<br />
<sup>3</sup> Usage limits are approximate and are not a hard limit.  Billing will be based on actual traces ingested.

<br />

## Questions and Answers
### I’ve been using LangSmith since before pricing took effect for new users. When will pricing go into effect for my account?
If you’ve been using LangSmith already, your usage will be billable starting sometime in May. At that point if you want to add seats or use more than the monthly allotment of free traces, you will need to add a credit card to LangSmith or contact sales. If you are interested in the Enterprise plan with higher rate limits and special deployment options, you can learn more or make a purchase by reaching out to [sales@langchain.dev](mailto:sales@langchain.dev).

### Which plan is right for me?
If you’re an individual developer, the Developer plan is a great choice for small projects. For teams that want to collaborate in LangSmith, check out the Plus plan. If you need more advanced administration, authentication and authorization, deployment options, support, or annual invoicing, the Enterprise plan is right for you.  If you are a seed-stage startup or educational institution, through the <b>LangSmith for Startups and Education</b> program you can apply for access to a special program with starter pricing for a period of time.  Please reach out via our [Sales Contact Form](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) for more details.

### What is a seat?
Seats are named to a specific developer. All accepted invitations to an account will be counted as a seat.

### What is a trace?
A trace is one complete invocation of your application chain or agent, evaluator run, or playground run. Here is an [example](https://smith.langchain.com/public/17c24270-9f74-47e7-b70c-d508afc448fa/r) of a single trace.

### What is an ingested event?
An ingested event is a run step as part of a trace or feedback that is submitted for a trace.  A trace can have multiple run steps and multiple pieces of feedback and each counts toward hourly rate limits.

### I’ve hit my usage limits. What can I do?
If you’ve consumed the monthly allotment of free traces in your account, you can add a credit card on the Developer and Plus plans to continue sending traces to LangSmith. If you’ve hit the rate limits on your tier, you can upgrade to a higher plan to get higher limits, or reach out to [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev) with questions.

### I have a developer account, can I upgrade my account to the Plus or Enterprise plan?
Every user will have a unique personal account on the Developer plan. <b>We cannot upgrade a Developer account to the Plus or Enterprise plans.</b> If you’re interested in working as a team, create a separate LangSmith Organization on the Plus plan.  This plan can upgraded to the Enterprise plan at a later date.

### How will billing work?
Seats are billed monthly on the first of the month in the future will be pro-rated if additional seats are purchased in the middle of the month. Seats removed mid-month will not be credited. You can purchase LangSmith credits for your tracing usage. As long as you have credits in your account, we’ll service your traces and deduct from your credit balance. You’ll be able to set alerts and auto-top ups on credits if you choose.

Enterprise plan customers are billed annually by invoice.

### What can I expect from Support?
On the Developer plan, community-based support is available on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6adMQxSpJS).

On the Plus plan, you will also receive preferential, email support at [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev) for LangSmith-related questions only.

On the Enterprise plan, you’ll get white-glove support with a Slack channel, a dedicated customer success manager, and monthly check-ins to go over LangSmith and LangChain questions. We can help with anything from debugging, agent and RAG techniques, evaluation approaches, and cognitive architecture reviews. If you purchase the add-on to run LangSmith in your environment, we’ll also support deployments and new releases with our infra engineering team on-call.

### Where is my data stored?
When using LangSmith hosted at smith.langchain.com, data is stored in GCP region `us-central-1`. If you’re on the Enterprise plan, we can deliver LangSmith to run on your kubernetes cluster in AWS, GCP, or Azure so that data never leaves your environment.

### Is LangSmith SOC 2 compliant?
We are in the process of getting our getting our SOC 2 certification. We will update the page when we’re certified.

### Will you train on the data that I send LangSmith?
We will not train on your data, and you own all rights to your data. See [LangSmith Terms of Service](https://langchain.dev/terms-of-service) for more information.
