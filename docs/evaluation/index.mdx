# Evaluation Quick Start

Evaluations are a quantitative way to measure performance of LLM applications, which is important because LLMs don't always behave predictably — small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare changes across different versions of your application, and build more reliable AI applications.

Evaluations are made up of three components:
1. A [dataset](/evaluation/concepts#datasets) with test inputs and optionally expected outputs.
2. A [target function](/evaluation/how_to_guides/define_target) that defines what you're evaluating. For example, this may be one LLM call that includes the new prompt you are testing, a part of your application or your end to end application. 
3. [Evaluators](/evaluation/concepts#evaluators) that score your target function's outputs.

This quick start guides you through running a simple evaluation to test the correctness of LLM responses with the LangSmith SDK or UI. 

<Tabs className="interface-tabs" queryString="mode">
  <TabItem value="sdk" label="SDK">

  This quickstart uses prebuilt LLM-as-judge evaluators from the open-source [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) package. OpenEvals includes a set of commonly used evaluators and is a great starting point if you're new to evaluations.
  If you want greater flexibility in how you evaluate your apps, you can also [define your own custom evaluators using arbitrary code](./evaluation/how_to_guides/custom_evaluator).

  ## 1. Install Dependencies

  <CodeTabs
    tabs={[
      {
        value: "python",
        label: "Python",
        language: "bash",
        content: `pip install -U langsmith openevals openai`,
      },
      {
        value: "typescript",
        label: "TypeScript",
        language: "bash",
        content: `npm install langsmith openevals openai`,
        footnote: "If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, you will also need to manually install \`@langchain/core\` as a peer dependency of `openevals`. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general - you may define evaluators [using arbitrary custom code](./evaluation/how_to_guides/custom_evaluator).",
      },
    ]}
    groupId="client-language"
  />

  ## 2. Create a LangSmith API key

  To create an API key, head to the <RegionalUrl text='Settings page' suffix='/settings' />. Then click **Create API Key.**

  ## 3. Set up your environment

  Because this quickstart uses OpenAI models, you'll need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable as well as the
  required LangSmith ones:

  <CodeTabs
    tabs={[
      ShellBlock(`export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
  export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<your-langchain-api-key>"

  # The example uses OpenAI, but it's not necessary in general
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your-openai-api-key>"`),
    ]}
    groupId="client-language"
  />

  ## 4. Create a dataset
  
  Next, define example input and reference output pairs that you'll use to evaluate your app:

  <CodeTabs
    tabs={[
      {
  value: "python",
  label: "Python",
  content: `from langsmith import Client

  client = Client()

  # Programmatically create a dataset in LangSmith
  # For other dataset creation methods, see:
  # https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/manage_datasets_programmatically
  # https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/manage_datasets_in_application
  dataset = client.create_dataset(
      dataset_name="Sample dataset", description="A sample dataset in LangSmith."
  )

  # Create examples
  examples = [
      {
          "inputs": {"question": "Which country is Mount Kilimanjaro located in?"},
          "outputs": {"answer": "Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania."},
      },
      {
          "inputs": {"question": "What is Earth's lowest point?"},
          "outputs": {"answer": "Earth's lowest point is The Dead Sea."},
      },
  ]

  # Add examples to the dataset
  client.create_examples(dataset_id=dataset.id, examples=examples)
  `,
      },
      {
        value: "typescript",
        label: "TypeScript",
        content: `import { Client } from "langsmith";

  const client = new Client();

  // Programmatically create a dataset in LangSmith
  // For other dataset creation methods, see:
  // https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/manage_datasets_programmatically
  // https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/manage_datasets_in_application
  const dataset = await client.createDataset("Sample dataset", {
    description: "A sample dataset in LangSmith.",
  });

  // Create inputs and reference outputs
  const examples = [
    {
      inputs: { question: "Which country is Mount Kilimanjaro located in?" },
      outputs: { answer: "Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania." },
      dataset_id: dataset.id,
    },
    {
      inputs: { question: "What is Earth's lowest point?" },
      outputs: { answer: "Earth's lowest point is The Dead Sea." },
      dataset_id: dataset.id,
    },
  ];

  // Add examples to the dataset
  await client.createExamples(examples);
  `,
  },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
  />

  ## 5. Define what you're evaluating

  Now, define a target function that wraps what you're evaluating. The below code contains a mock app that prompts an LLM to answer a question accurately, then returns the response as a string.
  You would wrap calls to your real app here:

  <CodeTabs
    tabs={[
      {
        value: "python",
        label: "Python",
        content: `from langsmith import wrappers
  from openai import OpenAI

  # Wrap the OpenAI client for LangSmith tracing
  openai_client = wrappers.wrap_openai(OpenAI())
        
  # Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function
  # The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function
  def target(inputs: dict) -> dict:
      response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
          model="gpt-4o-mini",
          messages=[
              {"role": "system", "content": "Answer the following question accurately"},
              {"role": "user", "content": inputs["question"]},
          ],
      )
      return { "answer": response.choices[0].message.content.strip() }
    `},
      {
        value: "typescript",
        label: "TypeScript",
        content: `import { wrapOpenAI } from "langsmith/wrappers";
  import OpenAI from "openai";

  const openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());

  // Define the application logic you want to evaluate inside a target function
  // The SDK will automatically send the inputs from the dataset to your target function
  async function target(inputs: { question: string }): Promise<{ answer: string }> {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "Answer the following question accurately" },
        { role: "user", content: inputs.question },
      ],
    });
    return { answer: response.choices[0].message.content?.trim() || "" };
  }
  `,
      },
    ]}
    groupId="client-language"
  />

  ## 6. Define evaluator

  Import a prebuilt prompt from [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) and create an evaluator.
  `outputs` are the result of your target function. `reference_outputs` / `referenceOutputs` are from the example pairs you defined in [step 4](#4-create-a-dataset) above.

  :::info
  `CORRECTNESS_PROMPT` is just an f-string with variables for `"inputs"`, `"outputs"`, and `"reference_outputs"`.
  See [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals#customizing-prompts) for more information on customizing OpenEvals prompts.
  :::

  <CodeTabs
    tabs={[
      {
        value: "python",
        label: "Python",
        content: `from openevals.llm import create_llm_as_judge
  from openevals.prompts import CORRECTNESS_PROMPT

  def correctness_evaluator(inputs: dict, outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict):
      evaluator = create_llm_as_judge(
          prompt=CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
          model="openai:o3-mini",
          feedback_key="correctness",
      )
      eval_result = evaluator(
          inputs=inputs,
          outputs=outputs,
          reference_outputs=reference_outputs
      )
      return eval_result`,
      },
      {
        value: "typescript",
        label: "TypeScript",
        content: `
  import { createLLMAsJudge, CORRECTNESS_PROMPT } from "openevals";

  const correctnessEvaluator = async (params: {
    inputs: Record<string, unknown>;
    outputs: Record<string, unknown>;
    referenceOutputs?: Record<string, unknown>;
  }) => {
    const evaluator = createLLMAsJudge({
      prompt: CORRECTNESS_PROMPT,
      model: "openai:o3-mini",
      feedbackKey: "correctness",
    });
    const evaluatorResult = await evaluator({
      inputs: params.inputs,
      outputs: params.outputs,
      referenceOutputs: params.referenceOutputs,
    });
    return evaluatorResult;
  };`,
      },
    ]}
    groupId="client-language"
  />

  ## 7. Run and view results
  
  Finally, run the experiment!

  <CodeTabs tabs={[
    
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      content: `# After running the evaluation, a link will be provided to view the results in langsmith
  experiment_results = client.evaluate(
      target,
      data="Sample dataset",
      evaluators=[
          correctness_evaluator,
          # can add multiple evaluators here
      ],
      experiment_prefix="first-eval-in-langsmith",
      max_concurrency=2,
  )
  `},
      {
        value: "typescript",
        label: "TypeScript",
        content: `import { evaluate } from "langsmith/evaluation";

  // After running the evaluation, a link will be provided to view the results in langsmith
  await evaluate(
    target,
    {
      data: "Sample dataset",
      evaluators: [
        correctnessEvaluator,
        // can add multiple evaluators here
      ],
      experimentPrefix: "first-eval-in-langsmith",
      maxConcurrency: 2,
    }
  );
  `,
      },
    ]}
    groupId="client-language"
  />

  Click the link printed out by your evaluation run to access the LangSmith Experiments UI, and explore the results of the experiment.
