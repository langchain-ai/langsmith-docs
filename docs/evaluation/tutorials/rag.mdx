:::

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge. It has become one of the most widely used approaches for building LLM applications.

This tutorial will show you how to evaluate your RAG applications using LangSmith. You'll learn:

1. How to create test datasets
2. How to run your RAG application on those datasets
3. How to measure your application's performance using different evaluation metrics

## Overview

A typical RAG evaluation workflow consists of three main steps:

1. Creating a dataset with questions and their expected answers
2. Running your RAG application on those questions
3. Using evaluators to measure how well your application performed, looking at factors like:
   - Answer relevance
   - Answer accuracy 
   - Retrieval quality

For this tutorial, we'll create and evaluate a bot that answers questions about a few of [Lilian Weng's](https://lilianweng.github.io/) insightful blog posts.

## Setup

### Environment

First, let's set our environment variables:

<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    python`
        import os

        os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
        os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "YOUR LANGCHAIN API KEY"
        os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
    `,
    typescript`
        process.env.LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 = "true";
        process.env.LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "YOUR LANGCHAIN API KEY";
        process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY";
    `,
  ]}
/>

And install the dependencies we'll need:

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "bash",
      content: `pip install -U langsmith langchain langchain-community langchain-openai`,
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "bash",
      content: `yarn add langsmith langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai`,
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

### Application

:::info Framework Flexibility
While this tutorial uses LangChain, the evaluation techniques and LangSmith functionality demonstrated here work with any framework. Feel free to use your preferred tools and libraries.
:::

In this section, we'll build a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.

We'll stick to a simple implementation that:
- Indexing: chunks and indexes a few of Lilian Weng's blogs in a vector store
- Retrieval: retrieves those chunks based on the user question
- Generation: passes the question and retrieved docs to an LLM.

#### Indexing and retrieval

First, lets load the blog posts we want to build a chatbot for and index them.



<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    python`
        from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
        from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
        from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
        from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

        # List of URLs to load documents from
        urls = [
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/",
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/",
        ]

        # Load documents from the URLs
        docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
        docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

        # Initialize a text splitter with specified chunk size and overlap
        text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
            chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=0
        )

        # Split the documents into chunks
        doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

        # Add the document chunks to the "vector store" using OpenAIEmbeddings
        vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(
            documents=doc_splits,
            embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
        )

        # With langchain we can easily turn any vector store into a retrieval component:
        retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=6)
    `,
    typescript`
        import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
        import { MemoryVectorStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/memory";
        import { BrowserbaseLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/browserbase";

        // List of URLs to load documents from
        const urls = [
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/",
            "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/",
        ]
        const loader = new BrowserbaseLoader(urls, {
            textContent: true,
        });
        const docs = await loader.load();

        const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
            chunkSize: 1000, chunkOverlap: 200
        });
        const allSplits = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);
        
        const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
            model: "text-embedding-3-large"
        });
        
        const vectorStore = new MemoryVectorStore(embeddings);  

        // Index chunks
        await vectorStore.addDocuments(allSplits)        
    `,
  ]}
/>

#### Generation

We can now define the generative pipeline. 

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    python`
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        from langsmith import traceable

        llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=1)

        # Add decorator so this function is traced in LangSmith
        @traceable()
        def rag_bot(question: str) -> dict:
            # LangChain retriever will be automatically traced
            docs = retriever.invoke(question)
            docs_string = "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)

            instructions = f"""You are a helpful assistant who is good at analyzing source information and answering questions. \

        Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.

        Documents:

            # langchain ChatModel will be automatically traced
            ai_msg = llm.invoke([
                    {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
                    {"role": "user", "content": question},
                ],
            )

            return {"answer": ai_msg.content, "documents": docs}
    `,
    typescript`
        import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
        import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
        
        const llm = new ChatOpenAI({
          model: "gpt-4o",
          temperature: 1,
        })
        
        // Add decorator so this function is traced in LangSmith
        const ragBot = traceable(
            async (question: string) => {
                // LangChain retriever will be automatically traced
                const retrievedDocs = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(question);
                const docsContent = retrievedDocs.map((doc) => doc.pageContent).join("\n");
                
                const instructions = \`You are a helpful assistant who is good at analyzing source information and answering questions

                Documents:

                const aiMsg = await llm.invoke([
                    {

                        content: question
                    }
                ])
                
                return {"answer": aiMsg.content, "documents": retrievedDocs}
            }
        )
    
    `
  ]}
/>

## Dataset

Now that we've got our application, let's build a dataset to evaluate it. Our dataset will be very simple in this case: we'll have example questions and reference answers.

<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    python`
        from langsmith import Client

        client = Client()

        # Define the examples for the dataset
        examples = [
            (
                "How does the ReAct agent use self-reflection? ",
                "ReAct integrates reasoning and acting, performing actions - such tools like Wikipedia search API - and then observing / reasoning about the tool outputs.",
            ),
            (
                "What are the types of biases that can arise with few-shot prompting?",
                "The biases that can arise with few-shot prompting include (1) Majority label bias, (2) Recency bias, and (3) Common token bias.",
            ),
            (
                "What are five types of adversarial attacks?",
                "Five types of adversarial attacks are (1) Token manipulation, (2) Gradient based attack, (3) Jailbreak prompting, (4) Human red-teaming, (5) Model red-teaming.",
            )
        ]

        # Create the dataset and examples in LangSmith
        dataset_name = "Lilian Weng Blogs Q&A"
        dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name=dataset_name)
        client.create_examples(
            inputs=[{"question": q} for q, _ in examples], 
            outputs=[{"answer": a} for _, a in examples], 
            dataset_id=dataset.id,
        )
    `,
    typescript`
        import { Client } from "langsmith";
      
        const client = new Client();
        
        // Define the examples for the dataset
        const examples = [
            [
                "How does the ReAct agent use self-reflection? ",
                "ReAct integrates reasoning and acting, performing actions - such tools like Wikipedia search API - and then observing / reasoning about the tool outputs.",
            ],
            [
                "What are the types of biases that can arise with few-shot prompting?",
                "The biases that can arise with few-shot prompting include (1) Majority label bias, (2) Recency bias, and (3) Common token bias.",
            ],
            [
                "What are five types of adversarial attacks?",
                "Five types of adversarial attacks are (1) Token manipulation, (2) Gradient based attack, (3) Jailbreak prompting, (4) Human red-teaming, (5) Model red-teaming.",
            ]
        ]
        
        const [inputs, outputs] = examples.reduce<
        [Array<{ input: string }>, Array<{ outputs: string }>]
        >(
            ([inputs, outputs], item) => [
            [...inputs, { input: item[0] }],
            [...outputs, { outputs: item[1] }],
            ],
            [[], []]
        );
        
        const datasetName = "Lilian Weng Blogs Q&A";
        const dataset = await client.createDataset(datasetName);
        await client.createExamples({ inputs, outputs, datasetId: dataset.id })
    `,
  ]}
/>

## Evaluators

One way to think about different types of RAG evaluators is as a tuple of what is being evaluated X what its being evaluated against:

1. **Correctness**: Response vs reference answer

- `Goal`: Measure "_how similar/correct is the RAG chain answer, relative to a ground-truth answer_"
- `Mode`: Requires a ground truth (reference) answer supplied through a dataset
- `Evaluator`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess answer correctness.

2. **Relevance**: Response vs input

- `Goal`: Measure "_how well does the generated response address the initial user input_"
- `Mode`: Does not require reference answer, because it will compare the answer to the input question
- `Evaluator`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess answer relevance, helpfulness, etc.

3. **Groundedness**: Response vs retrieved docs

- `Goal`: Measure "_to what extent does the generated response agree with the retrieved context_"
- `Mode`: Does not require reference answer, because it will compare the answer to the retrieved context
- `Evaluator`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess faithfulness, hallucinations, etc.

4. **Retrieval relevance**: Retrieved docs vs input

- `Goal`: Measure "_how relevant are my retrieved results for this query_"
- `Mode`: Does not require reference answer, because it will compare the question to the retrieved context
- `Evaluator`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess relevance

### Correctness: Response vs reference answer

<CodeTabs

### Relevance: Response vs input

The flow is similar to above, but we simply look at the `inputs` and `outputs` without needing the `reference_outputs`.
Without a reference answer we can't grade accuracy, but can still grade relevance—as in, did the model address the user's question or not.
