# RAG Evaluations

RAG (retrieval augmented generation) has become one of the most popular applications of LLMs today.
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to evaluate the performance of an RAG application using LangSmith.

## Overview

Evaluating RAG applications involves creating a dataset, running your RAG application, and then evaluating the performance of your application using different types of evaluators.

![rag_overview.png](./static/rag_overview.png)

## Setup

First, let's set our environment variables:

```python
import os

os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "YOUR LANGCHAIN API KEY"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"
```

## Dataset

We are going to create a dataset from Lilian Weng's blogposts to use RAG on. Note that if you already have a dataset you want to test on, you can skip this step.

```python
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()

# Create examples for the dataset
examples = [
    (
        "How does the ReAct agent use self-reflection? ",
        "ReAct integrates reasoning and acting, performing actions - such tools like Wikipedia search API - and then observing / reasoning about the tool outputs.",
    ),
    (
        "What are the types of biases that can arise with few-shot prompting?",
        "The biases that can arise with few-shot prompting include (1) Majority label bias, (2) Recency bias, and (3) Common token bias.",
    ),
    (
        "What are five types of adversarial attacks?",
        "Five types of adversarial attacks are (1) Token manipulation, (2) Gradient based attack, (3) Jailbreak prompting, (4) Human red-teaming, (5) Model red-teaming.",
    )
]

# Save the examples to LangSmith
dataset_name = "RAG Agent Evaluation"
dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name=dataset_name)
inputs, outputs = zip(
    *[({"input": text}, {"output": label}) for text, label in examples]
)
client.create_examples(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, dataset_id=dataset.id)
```

## RAG application

:::tip LangSmith
For this tutorial we are using LangChain, but LangSmith works regardless of whether or not your pipeline is built with LangChain.
:::

Now we can define our RAG application. Again, if you already have a RAG application, you can skip this step.
We will be using a fairly simple RAG app for this tutorial but there are plenty of ways you can improve on it such as
introducing extra reasoning steps, adding feedback loops, etc.

### Vector Store and Retriever

First, let's define our vector store and retriever, grabbing the blog posts that our questions/answer pairs are based on.

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SKLearnVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# List of URLs to load documents from
urls = [
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/",
    "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/",
]

# Load documents from the URLs
docs = [WebBaseLoader(url).load() for url in urls]
docs_list = [item for sublist in docs for item in sublist]

# Initialize a text splitter with specified chunk size and overlap
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    chunk_size=250, chunk_overlap=0
)

# Split the documents into chunks
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_list)

# Add the document chunks to the "vector store" using OpenAIEmbeddings
vectorstore = SKLearnVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=doc_splits,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(k=4)
```

### Application

We can now define the application by creating functions to retrieve docs, invoke the LLM, and get the answer. 

```python
import openai
from langsmith import traceable
from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai

class RagBot:

    def __init__(self, retriever, model: str = "gpt-4-0125-preview"):
        self._retriever = retriever
        # Wrapping the client instruments the LLM
        self._client = wrap_openai(openai.Client())
        self._model = model

    @traceable()
    def retrieve_docs(self, question):
        return self._retriever.invoke(question)

    @traceable()
    def invoke_llm(self, question, docs):
        response = self._client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self._model,
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": f"""You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.

                    Use the following documents to answer the question.

                    If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.

                    Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.
                    Documents: {docs}
                    Answer:""",
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": question,
                },
            ],
        )

        # Evaluators will expect "answer" and "contexts"
        return {
            "answer": response.choices[0].message.content,
            "contexts": [str(doc) for doc in docs],
        }

    @traceable()
    def get_answer(self, question: str):
        docs = self.retrieve_docs(question)
        return self.invoke_llm(question, docs)

rag_bot = RagBot(retriever)
```

### Predictors

We can now define predictor functions to call, which will:

1. Take a dataset `example`
2. Extract the relevant key (e.g., `question`) from the `example`
3. Pass it to the RAG chain
4. Return the relevant output values from the RAG chain (either just the answer, or the asnwer and the context)

```python
def predict_rag_answer(example: dict):
    """Use this for answer evaluation"""
    response = rag_bot.get_answer(example["input_question"])
    return {"answer": response["answer"]}

def predict_rag_answer_with_context(example: dict):
    """Use this for evaluation of retrieved documents and hallucinations"""
    response = rag_bot.get_answer(example["input_question"])
    return {"answer": response["answer"], "contexts": response["contexts"]}
```

## Evaluator

There are at least 4 types of RAG eval that users are typically interested in.

1. **Response vs reference answer**

- `Goal`: Measure "_how similar/correct is the RAG chain answer, relative to a ground-truth answer_"
- `Mode`: Uses ground truth (reference) answer supplied through a dataset
- `Judge`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess answer correctness.

2. **Response vs input**

- `Goal`: Measure "_how well does the generated response address the initial user input_"
- `Mode`: Reference-free, because it will compare the answer to the input question
- `Judge`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess answer relevance, helpfulness, etc.

3. **Response vs retrieved docs**

- `Goal`: Measure "_to what extent does the generated response agree with the retrieved context_"
- `Mode`: Reference-free, because it will compare the answer to the retrieved context
- `Judge`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess faithfulness, hallucinations, etc.

4. **Retrieved docs vs input**

- `Goal`: Measure "_how good are my retrieved results for this query_"
- `Mode`: Reference-free, because it will compare the question to the retrieved context
- `Judge`: Use LLM-as-judge to assess relevance

### Response vs reference answer

Here is an example prompt that we can use:

https://smith.langchain.com/hub/langchain-ai/rag-answer-vs-reference

Here is the a video from our LangSmith evaluation series for reference:

https://youtu.be/lTfhw_9cJqc?feature=shared

Here is our evaluator function:

- `run` is the invocation of `predict_rag_answer`, which has key `answer`
- `example` is from our eval set, which has keys `input_question` and `output_answer`
- We extract these values and pass them into our grader

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Grade(BaseModel):
    Score: int = Field(..., description="Provide the score on whether the answer is correct")
    Explanation: str = Field(..., description="Explain your reasoning for the score")

# Grade prompt
grade_prompt_answer_accuracy_messages = [
    SystemMessage(
        content="""You are a teacher grading a quiz. 

        You will be given a QUESTION, the GROUND TRUTH (correct) ANSWER, and the STUDENT ANSWER. 

        Here is the grade criteria to follow:
        (1) Grade the student answers based ONLY on their factual accuracy relative to the ground truth answer. 
        (2) Ensure that the student answer does not contain any conflicting statements.
        (3) It is OK if the student answer contains more information than the ground truth answer, as long as it is factually accurate relative to the  ground truth answer.

        Score:
        A score of 1 means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria. This is the highest (best) score. 
        A score of 0 means that the student's answer does not meet all of the criteria. This is the lowest possible score you can give.
        
        Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. 

        Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""
    ),
    HumanMessage(
        content="""QUESTION: {{question}}
        GROUND TRUTH ANSWER: {{correct_answer}}
        STUDENT ANSWER: {{student_answer}}"""
    ),
]

grade_prompt_answer_accuracy = ChatPromptTemplate(grade_prompt_answer_accuracy_messages)

def answer_evaluator(run, example) -> dict:
    """
    A simple evaluator for RAG answer accuracy
    """

    # Get question, ground truth answer, RAG chain answer
    input_question = example.inputs["input_question"]
    reference = example.outputs["output_answer"]
    prediction = run.outputs["answer"]

    # LLM grader
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo", temperature=0)
    grade_answer_accuracy_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Grade)

    # Structured prompt
    answer_grader = grade_prompt_answer_accuracy | grade_answer_accuracy_llm

    # Run evaluator
    score = answer_grader.invoke({"question": input_question,
                                  "correct_answer": reference,
                                  "student_answer": prediction})
    score = score["Score"]

    return {"key": "answer_v_reference_score", "score": score}
```

Now, we kick off evaluation:

- `predict_rag_answer`: Takes an `example` from our eval set, extracts the question, passes to our RAG chain
- `answer_evaluator`: Passes RAG chain answer, question, and ground truth answer to an evaluator

```python
from langsmith import evaluate

experiment_results = evaluate(
    predict_rag_answer,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=[answer_evaluator],
    experiment_prefix="rag-answer-v-reference",
    metadata={"version": "LCEL context, gpt-4-0125-preview"},
)
```

### Response vs input

Here is an example prompt that we can use:

https://smith.langchain.com/hub/langchain-ai/rag-answer-helpfulness

The information flow is similar to above, but we simply look at the `run` answer versus the `example` question.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

### Response vs retrieved docs

Here is an example prompt that we can use:

### Retrieved docs vs input

Here is an example prompt that we can use:

## Evaluating intermediate steps

Above, we returned the retrieved documents as part of the final answer.

However, we will show that this is not required.

We can isolate them as intermediate chain steps.

See detail on isolating intermediate chain steps [here](../how_to_guides/evaluate_on_intermediate_steps).
