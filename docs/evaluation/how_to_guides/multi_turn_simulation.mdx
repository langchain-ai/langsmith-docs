AI applications with conversational interfaces, like chatbots, operate over multiple interactions with a user, also called conversation *turns*.
When evaluating the performance of such applications, core concepts such as [building a dataset](../../evaluation/concepts#datasets) and defining
[evaluators](../../evaluation/concepts#evaluators) and metrics to judge your app outputs remain useful. However, you may also find it useful to
run a *simulation* between your app and a user, then evaluate this dynamically created trajectory.

Some advantages of doing this are:

- Ease of getting started vs. an evaluation over a full dataset of pre-existing trajectories
- End-to-end coverage from an initial query until a successful or unsuccessful resolution
- The ability to detect repetitive behavior or context loss over several iterations of your app

The downside is that because you are broadening your evaluation surface area to contain multiple turns, there is less consistency
than evaluating a single output from your app given a static input from a dataset.

![](./static/multi_turn_trace.png)

This guide will show you how to simulate multi-turn interactions and evaluate them using the open-source [`openevals`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) package,
which contains prebuilt evaluators and other convenient resources for evaluating your AI apps. It will also use OpenAI models,
though you can use other providers as well.

## Setup

First, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      value: "python",
      label: "Python",
      language: "bash",
      content: `pip install -U langsmith openevals`,
    },
    {
      value: "typescript",
      label: "TypeScript",
      language: "bash",
      content: `npm install langsmith openevals`,
      footnote: "If you are using `yarn` as your package manager, you will also need to manually install \`@langchain/core\` as a peer dependency of `openevals`. This is not required for LangSmith evals in general.",
    },
  ]}
  groupId="client-language"
/>

And set up your environment variables:

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<Your LangSmith API key>"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<Your OpenAI API key>"
```

## Running a simulation

There are two primary components you'll need to get started:

- `app`: Your application, or a function wrapping it. Must accept a single chat message (dict with "role" and "content" keys) as an input arg and a `thread_id` as a kwarg.
Should accept other kwargs as more may be added in future releases. Returns a chat message as output with at least role and content keys.
- `user`: The simulated user. In this guide, we will use an imported prebuilt function named `create_llm_simulated_user` which uses an LLM to generate user responses, though you can [create your own too](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-simulated-users).

The simulator in `openevals` passes a single chat message to your `app` from the `user` for each turn.
Therefore you should statefully track the current history internally based on `thread_id` if needed.

Here's an example that simulates a multi-turn customer support interaction. This guide uses a simple chat app that wraps a single call to the OpenAI chat completions API, however this is where you would call your application or agent. 
In this example, our simulated user is playing the role of a particularly aggressive customer:

<CodeTabs

The response looks like this:

Thank you for your patience.",
      refusal: null,
      annotations: [],

      id: 'a0536d4f-9353-4cfa-84df-51c8d29e076d'
    }
  ]
}
```


The simulation first generates an initial query from the simulated `user`, then passes response chat messages
back and forth until it reaches `max_turns` (you can alternatively pass a `stopping_condition` that takes
the current trajectory and returns `True` or `False` - [see the OpenEvals README for more information](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals?tab=readme-ov-file#multiturn-simulation)).
The return value is the final list of chat messages that make up the converation's **trajectory**.

:::info
There are several ways to configure the simulated user, such as having it return fixed responses for the first turns of your simulation,
as well as the simulation as a whole. For full details, check out [the OpenEvals README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals?tab=readme-ov-file#multiturn-simulation).
:::

The final trace will look something [like this](https://smith.langchain.com/public/648ca37d-1c4d-4f7b-9b6a-89e35dc5d4f0/r) with responses from your `app` and `user` interleaved:

Congrats! You just ran your first multi-turn simulation. Next, we'll cover how to run it in a LangSmith experiment.

## Running in LangSmith experiments

You can use the results of multi-turn simulations as part of a LangSmith experiment to track performance and progress over time.
For these sections, it helps to be familiar with at least one of LangSmith's [`pytest`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest) (Python-only),
[`Vitest`/`Jest`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/vitest_jest) (JS only),
or [`evaluate`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/evaluate_llm_application) runners.

### Using `pytest` or `Vitest/Jest`

:::tip
See the following guides to learn how to set up evals using LangSmith's integrations with test frameworks:

- [`pytest`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/pytest)
- [`Vitest` or `Jest`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/vitest_jest)
:::

If you are using one of the [LangSmith test framework integrations](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides#testing-integrations),
you can pass in an array of OpenEvals evaluators as a `trajectory_evaluators` param when running the simulation.
These evaluators will run at the end of the simulation, taking the final list of chat messages as
an `outputs` kwarg. Your passed `trajectory_evaluator` must therefore accept this kwarg.

LangSmith will automatically detect and log the feedback returned from the passed `trajectory_evaluators`, adding it to the experiment.
Note also that the test case uses the `fixed_responses` param on the simulated user to start the conversation with a specific input,
which you can log and make part of your stored dataset.

You may also find it convenient to have the simulated user's system prompt to be part of your logged dataset as well.

### Using `evaluate`

You can also use the [`evaluate`](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides/evaluate_llm_application)
runner to evaluate simulated multi-turn interactions. This will be a little bit different from the `pytest`/`Vitest`/`Jest` example in the following ways:

- The simulation should be part of your `target` function, and your target function should return the final trajectory.
  - This will make the trajectory the `outputs` that LangSmith will pass to your evaluators.
- Instead of using the `trajectory_evaluators` param, you should pass your evaluators as a param into the `evaluate()` method.
- You will need an existing dataset of inputs and (optionally) reference trajectories.

## Modifying the simulated user persona

The above examples run using the same simulated user persona for all input examples, defined by the `system` parameter
passed into `create_llm_simulated_user`. If you would like to use a different persona for specific items in your dataset,
you can update your dataset examples to also contain an extra field with the desired `system` prompt, then pass that
field in when creating your simulated user like this:

## Next Steps

You've just seen some techniques for simulating multi-turn interactions and running them in LangSmith evals.

Here are some topics you might want to explore next:

- [Trace multiturn conversations across different traces](../../observability/how_to_guides/threads)
- [Use multiple messages in the playground UI](../../prompt_engineering/how_to_guides/multiple_messages)
- [Return multiple metrics in one evaluator](../../evaluation/how_to_guides/multiple_scores)

You can also explore the [OpenEvals readme](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openevals) for more on prebuilt evaluators.
