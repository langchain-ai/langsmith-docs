# How to set up a multi-turn evaluation

LangSmith makes it easy to evaluate multi-turn conversations in the playground. This allows you to evaluate how changing your system prompt,
the tools available to the model, or the output schema affects a conversation with multiple messages.

This how-to guide walks you through the various ways you can set up the playground for multi-turn evaluation, which will allow you to
test different tool configurations and system prompts to see how they impact your system.

## From an existing run

First, ensure you have properly [traced](../../observability) a multi-turn conversation, and then navigate to your tracing
project. Once you get to your tracing project simply open the run, select the LLM call, and open it in the playground as follows:

You can then edit the system prompt, tweak the tools and/or output schema and observe how the output of the multi-turn conversation changes.

## From a dataset

Before starting, make sure you have [set up your dataset](../../evaluation/how_to_guides/manage_datasets_in_application). Since you want to evaluate
multi-turn conversations, make sure there is a key in your inputs that contains a list of messages.

Once you have created your dataset, head to the playground and [load your dataset](../../prompt_engineering/how_to_guides/testing_over_dataset) to evaluate.

Then, add a messages list variable to your prompt, making sure to name it the same as the key in your inputs that contains the list of messages:

When you run your prompt, the messages from each example will be added as a list in place of the 'Messages List' variable.

## Manually

There are two ways to manually create multi-turn conversations. The first way is by simply appending messages to the prompt:

This is helpful for quick iteration, but is rigid since the multi-turn conversation is hardcoded.
Instead, if you want your prompt to work with any multi-turn conversation you can add a 'Messages List' variable and add your
multi-turn conversation there:

This allows you to just tweak the system prompt or the tools, while allowing any multi-turn conversation to take the place
of the `Messages List` variable, allowing you to reuse this prompt across various evaluations.

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to set up your multi-turn evaluation, you can either do "vibe" evaluations by manually 
inspecting and judging the outputs, or you can [add evaluators](../how_to_guides#define-an-evaluator) to get quantitative results.
