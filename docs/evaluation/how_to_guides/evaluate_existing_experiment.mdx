# How to evaluate an existing experiment (Python only)

:::inof
Evaluation of existing experiments is currently only supported in the Python SDK.
:::

If you have already run an experiment and want to add additional evaluation metrics, you
can apply any evaluators to the experiment using the `evaluate()` / `aevaluate()` methods as before.
Just pass in the experiment name / ID instead of a target function:

```python
from langsmith import evaluate

def always_half(inputs: dict, outputs: dict) -> float:
    return 0.5

experiment_name = "my-experiment:abc" # Replace with an actual experiment name or ID
evaluate(experiment_name, evaluators=[always_half])
```
