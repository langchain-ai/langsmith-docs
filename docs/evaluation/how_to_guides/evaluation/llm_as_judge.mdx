# How to define an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator

:::info Key concepts

- [LLM-as-a-judge evaluator](../../concepts#llm-as-judge)

:::

LLM applications can be difficult to evaluate because often they're generating conversational text for which there's no single "right" answer.
An imperfect but valuable way to evaluate such applications is to use a second LLM to judge the outputs of the first.
This can be especially useful if a smaller model is used in the application and a larger, better model is used for evaluation.

## Custom evaluator via SDK

For maximal control of evaluator logic, we can write a custom evaluator and run it using the SDK.
