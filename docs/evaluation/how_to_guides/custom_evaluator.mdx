# How to define a custom evaluator

:::info Key concepts

- [Evaluators](../concepts#evaluators)

:::

Custom evaluators are just functions that take a dataset example and the resulting application output, and return one or more metrics.
These functions can be passed directly into [evaluate()](https://langsmith-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation/langsmith.evaluation._runner.evaluate.html) / [aevaluate()](https://langsmith-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation/langsmith.evaluation._arunner.aevaluate.html).

## Basic example

<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    python({caption: "Requires `langsmith>=0.2.0`"})`
        from langsmith import evaluate

        def correct(outputs: dict, reference_outputs: dict) -> bool:
        """Check if the answer exactly matches the expected answer."""
            return outputs["answer"] == reference_outputs["answer"]

        def dummy_app(inputs: dict) -> dict:
            return {"answer": "hmm i'm not sure", "reasoning": "i didn't understand the question"}

        results = evaluate(
            dummy_app,
            data="dataset_name",
            evaluators=[correct]
        )
    `,
    typescript({caption: "Requires `langsmith>=0.2.9`"})`
      import type { EvaluationResult } from "langsmith/evaluation";

      const correct = async ({ outputs, referenceOutputs }: {
        outputs: Record<string, any>;
        referenceOutputs?: Record<string, any>;
      }): Promise<EvaluationResult> => {
        const score = outputs?.answer === referenceOutputs?.answer;
        return { key: "correct", score };
      }
    `,

]}
/>

## Evaluator args

Custom evaluator functions must have specific argument names. They can take any subset of the following arguments:

Python and JS/TS

- `run: langsmith.schemas.Run`: The full Run object generated by the application on the given example.
- `example: langsmith.schemas.Example`: The full dataset Example, including the example inputs, outputs (if available), and metdata (if available).

Currently Python only

- `inputs: dict`: A dictionary of the inputs corresponding to a single example in a dataset.
- `outputs: dict`: A dictionary of the outputs generated by the application on the given `inputs`.
- `reference_outputs: dict`: A dictionary of the reference outputs associated with the example, if available.

For most use cases you'll only need `inputs`, `outputs`, and `reference_outputs`. `run` and `example` are useful only if you need some extra trace or example metadata outside of the actual inputs and outputs of the application.

## Evaluator output

Custom evaluators are expected to return one of the following types:

Python and JS/TS

- `dict`: dicts of the form `{"score" | "value": ..., "name": ...}` allow you to customize the metric type ("score" for numerical and "value" for categorical) and metric name. This if useful if, for example, you want to log an integer as a categorical metric.

Currently Python only

- `int | float | bool`: this is interepreted as an continuous metric that can be averaged, sorted, etc. The function name is used as the name of the metric.
- `str`: this is intepreted as a categorical metric. The function name is used as the name of the metric.
- `list[dict]`: return multiple metrics using a single function.

        def concision(outputs: dict) -> int:

            return min(len(outputs["answer"]) // 1000, 4) + 1
