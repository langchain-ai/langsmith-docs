# Run an evaluation with large file inputs

In addition to supporting [file attachments with traces](../../../observability/how_to_guides/upload_files_with_traces), LangSmith supports arbitrary file attachments with your examples, which you can consume when you run experiments.

This is particularly useful when working with LLM applications that require multimodal inputs or outputs.

:::tip Using separate attachments outside of inputs/outputs
When dealing with large files, it's recommended to upload them as attachments rather than embedding them in your JSON inputs or outputs via base64 encoding.

Attachments are more efficient because base64 encoding increases data size, leading to slower uploads and downloads.
This also avoid potential performance bottlenecks with parsing large JSON payloads.

Finally, attachments are more user-friendly in the LangSmith UI, as they are rendered as files with previews, rather than as base64-encoded strings.

## Add examples with attachments to a LangSmith dataset

### SDK

To upload examples with attachments using the SDK, you need to use the `upload_examples_multipart`/`update_examples_multipart` Python methods or the `uploadExamplesMultipart`/`updateExamplesMultipart` TypeScript methods.
This method allows you to pass in a list of examples with attachments.

:::note Minimum SDK Versions
All of the below features are available in the following SDK versions:

- Python SDK: >=0.2.3
- JS/TS SDK: >=0.2.13

Once you upload examples with attachments, you can view them in the LangSmith UI. Each attachment will be rendered as a file with a preview, making it easy to inspect the contents.

### From existing runs

When adding runs to a LangSmith dataset, attachments can be selectively propagated from the source run to the destination example.
To learn more, please see [this guide](./manage_datasets_in_application#add-runs-from-the-tracing-project-ui).

![](./static/add_trace_with_attachments_to_dataset.png)

### From the LangSmith UI

You can also upload examples with attachments directly from the LangSmith UI. You can do so by clicking the `+ Example` button in the `Examples` tab of the dataset UI.
You can then upload the attachments that you want by using the "Upload Files" button:

## Running evaluations with attachments

Once you have a dataset that contains examples with file attachments, you can run evaluations that process these attachments.

### Define a target function with attachments

Now that we have a dataset that includes examples with attachments, we can define a target function to run over these examples.
The following example simply uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to answer questions about an image and an audio clip.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\n

client = wrap_openai(OpenAI())\n

def file_qa(inputs, attachments): # Read the audio bytes from the reader and encode them in base64
    audio_reader = attachments["my_wav"]["reader"]
    audio_b64 = base64.b64encode(audio_reader.read()).decode('utf-8')
    audio_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-audio-preview",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",

                },

                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]\n
    # Most models support taking in an image URL directly in addition to base64 encoded images
    # You can pipe the image pre-signed URL directly to the model
    image_url = attachments["my_img"]["presigned_url"]
    image_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[

                "image_url": {
                  "url": image_url,
                },
              },
            ],
          }
        ],
    )\n
    return {
        "audio_answer": audio_completion.choices[0].message.content,
        "image_answer": image_completion.choices[0].message.content,

- The \`inputs\` argument is a dictionary that contains the input data for the example, excluding the attachments.

Each value in the attachments dictionary is a dictionary with the following structure:

### Define custom evaluators with attachments

In addition to using attachments inside of your target function, you can also use them inside of your evaluators as follows.
The exact same rules apply as above to determine whether the evaluator should receive attachments.

The evaluator below uses an LLM to judge if the reasoning and the answer are consistent.
To learn more about how to define llm-based evaluators, please see [this guide](./llm_as_judge).

## Manage datasets with attachments

### Manage programmatically

In the code [above](#add-examples-with-attachments-to-a-langsmith-dataset), we showed how to add examples with attachments to a dataset.
It is also possible to update these same examples using the SDK.

As with existing examples, datasets are versioned when you update them with attachments. Therefore, you can navigate to the dataset version history to see the changes made to each example.
To learn more, please see [this guide](./manage_datasets_in_application).

When updating an example with attachments, you can update attachments in a few different ways:

- Pass in new attachments
- Rename existing attachments
- Delete existing attachments

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`from langsmith.schemas import ExampleUpdateWithAttachments, AttachmentsOperations
    
example_update = ExampleUpdateWithAttachments(
    id=example_id,
    attachments={

        "my_new_file": ("text/plain", b"foo bar"),
    },
    attachments_operations=AttachmentsOperations(
        # Retained attachments will stay exactly the same
        retain=["my_img"],
        # Renaming attachments preserves the original data
        rename={
            "my_wav": "my_new_wav",
        }
        # Any attachments not in rename/retain will be deleted
        # In this case, that would be "my_pdf"
    ),
)

langsmith_client.update_example_with_attachments(dataset_id=dataset.id, updates=[example_update])
`),
    TypeScriptBlock(`import { ExampleUpdateWithAttachments } from "langsmith/schemas";

const exampleUpdate: ExampleUpdateWithAttachments = {
id: exampleId,
attachments: {
// These are net new attachments
"my_new_file": {
mimeType: "text/plain",
data: Buffer.from("foo bar")
},
},
attachments_operations: {
// Retained attachments will stay exactly the same
retain: ["my_img"],
// Renaming attachments preserves the original data
rename: {
"my_wav": "my_new_wav",
},
// Any attachments not in rename/retain will be deleted
// In this case, that would be "my_pdf"
},
};

await langsmithClient.updateExamplesMultipart(
dataset.id,
[exampleUpdate],
);
`),
]}
groupId="client-language"
/>

:::warning Attachment Operations
Currently, errors are not thrown if you pass the wrong attaachment name to `rename` or `retain`.
New attachments **ALWAYS** take precedence over existing attachments. So if you upload a new attachment
name "foo" and try to retain or rename an existing attachment to "foo", the new attachment will be used instead.

Anything not in `rename` or `retain` will be deleted.
:::

### From the LangSmith UI

:::note Attachment Size Limit
Attachments are limited to 20MB in size in the UI.
:::

When editing an example in the UI, you can upload new attachments, rename and delete attachemnts,
and there is also a quick reset button to restore the attachments to what previously existed on the example.
No changes will be saved until you click submit.
