# Run an evaluation with multimodal content

LangSmith supports creating dataset examples with file attachments, which you can consume when running evals over that dataset.

Attachments are particularly valuable for LLM applications that work with multimodal inputs or outputs, such as images, audio, or documents. While you can include multimodal data in your examples by base64 encoding it, this approach is inefficient - the encoded data takes up more space than the original binary files, resulting in slower transfers to and from LangSmith. Using attachments instead provides two key benefits:

1. Faster upload and download speeds due to more efficient binary file transfers
2. Enhanced visualization of different file types in the LangSmith UI

## Create examples with attachments

To upload examples with attachments using the SDK, use the [create_examples](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/client/langsmith.client.Client#langsmith.client.Client.create_examples) / [update_examples](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/python/client/langsmith.client.Client#langsmith.client.Client.update_examples) Python methods or the [uploadExamplesMultipart](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/js/classes/client.Client#uploadexamplesmultipart) / [updateExamplesMultipart](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/reference/js/classes/client.Client#updateexamplesmultipart) TypeScript methods.

Each attachment requires either a \`Uint8Array\` or an \`ArrayBuffer\` as the data type.\n

- \`Uint8Array\`: Useful for handling binary data directly.
- \`ArrayBuffer\`: Represents fixed-length binary data, which can be converted to \`Uint8Array\` as needed.\n
Note that you cannot directly pass in a file path in the TypeScript SDK, as accessing local files is not supported in all runtime environments.\n

:::info Uploading from filesystem

Along with being passed in as bytes, attachments can be specified as paths to local files.
To do so pass in a path for the attachment `data` value and specify arg `dangerously_allow_filesystem=True`:

```python
client.create_examples(..., dangerously_allow_filesystem=True)
```

## Run evaluations

### Define a target function 

Now that we have a dataset that includes examples with attachments, we can define a target function to run over these examples.
The following example simply uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to answer questions about an image and an audio clip.

### Define custom evaluators

The exact same rules apply as above to determine whether the evaluator should receive attachments.

The evaluator below uses an LLM to judge if the reasoning and the answer are consistent.

## Update examples with attachments

In the code above, we showed how to add examples with attachments to a dataset.
It is also possible to update these same examples using the SDK.

As with existing examples, datasets are versioned when you update them with attachments. Therefore, you can navigate to the dataset version history to see the changes made to each example.
To learn more, please see [this guide](./manage_datasets_in_application).

When updating an example with attachments, you can update attachments in a few different ways:

- Pass in new attachments
- Rename existing attachments
- Delete existing attachments

Note that:
- Any existing attachments that are not explicitly renamed or retained **will be deleted**.
- An error will be raised if you pass in a non-existent attachment name to `retain` or `rename`.
- New attachments take precedence over existing attachments in case the same attachment name appears in the `attachments` and `attachment_operations` fields.

## Create examples with attachments

You can add examples with attachments to a dataset in a few different ways.

### From existing runs

When adding runs to a LangSmith dataset, attachments can be selectively propagated from the source run to the destination example.
To learn more, please see [this guide](./manage_datasets_in_application#add-runs-from-the-tracing-project-ui).

![](./static/add_trace_with_attachments_to_dataset.png)

### From scratch

You can upload examples with attachments directly from the LangSmith UI. Click the `+ Example` button in the `Examples` tab of the dataset UI.
Then upload attachments using the "Upload Files" button:

![](./static/create_example_with_attachments.png)

Once uploaded, you can view examples with attachments in the LangSmith UI. Each attachment will be rendered with a preview for easy inspection.
![](./static/attachments_with_examples.png)

## Create a multimodal prompt
The LangSmith UI allows you to include attachments in your prompts when evaluating multimodal models:

First, click the file icon in the message where you want to add multimodal content.
Next, add a template variable for the attachment(s) you want to include for each example.
- For a single attachment type: Use the suggested variable name. Note: all examples must have an attachment with this name.
- For multiple attachments or if your attachments have varying names from one example to another: Use the `All attachments` variable to include all available attachments for each example.

![](./static/adding_multimodal_variable.gif)

## Define custom evaluators

:::note Multimodal evaluators
The LangSmith playground does not currently support pulling multimodal content into evaluators. If this would be helpful for your use case, please let us know in the [LangChain's community Slack](https://langchaincommunity.slack.com/) (sign up [here](https://www.langchain.com/join-community) if you're not already a member)!
:::

You can evaluate a model's text output by adding an evaluator that takes in the example's inputs and outputs.
Even without multimodal support in your evaluators, you can still run text-only evaluations. For example:

- OCR → text correction: Use a vision model to extract text from a document, then evaluate the accuracy of the extracted output.
- Speech-to-text → transcription quality: Use a voice model to transcribe audio to text, then evaluate the transcription against your reference.

For more information on defining custom evaluators, see the [LLM as Judge](../how_to_guides/llm_as_judge) guide.

## Update examples with attachments

:::note Attachment Size Limit
Attachments are limited to 20MB in size in the UI.
:::

When editing an example in the UI, you can:
- Upload new attachments
- Rename and delete attachments  
- Reset attachments to their previous state using the quick reset button

Changes are not saved until you click submit.
