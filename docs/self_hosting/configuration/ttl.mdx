# TTL and Data Retention

LangSmith Self-Hosted allows enablement of automatic TTL and Data Retention of traces. This can be useful if you're complying with data privacy regulations, or if you want to have more efficient space usage and auto cleanup of your traces.
Traces will also have their data retention period automatically extended based on certain actions or run rule applications. For more details on Data Retention, take a look at the section on auto-upgrades in the [data retention guide](/administration/concepts#data-retention).

## Requirements

You can configure retention through helm or environment variable settings. There are a few options that are
configurable:

- _Enabled:_ Whether data retention is enabled or disabled. If enabled, via the UI you can your default organization and project TTL tiers to apply to traces (see [data retention guide](/administration/concepts#data-retention) for details).
- _Retention Periods:_ You can configure system-wide retention periods for shortlived and longlived traces. Once configured, you can manage the retention level at each project as well as set an organization-wide default for new projects.

# Clickhouse TTL Cleanup Job
As of version <b><u>0.11</u></b>, a cron job will run on weekends to assist in deleting expired data that may have not been cleaned up by ClickHouse's built in TTL mechanism.

By default, it runs:
- Saturday: <b>8pm/10pm UTC</b>
- Sunday: <b>12am/2am/4am UTC</b>

## Disabling the Job
If you would like to disable the job entirely, you can set the following values in your `values.yaml` file

```yaml
queue:
  extraEnv:
    - name: "ENABLE_CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON"
      value: "false"
```

## Customizing the Job
You can set the following parameters to customize the job.
:::warning NOTE
If you want the job to only run on a singular cron schedule, set `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_EVENING` and `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_MORNING` to the same value. We use 
locking to prevent job overlaps.
:::
```yaml
queue:
  extraEnv:
    # UTC: Sun 12am/2am/4am
    - name: "CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_MORNING"
      value: "0 0,2,4 * * 0"
    # UTC: Sat 8pm/10pm
    - name: "CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CLEANUP_CRON_WEEKEND_EVENING"
      value: "0 20,22 * * 6"
    # 100K rows
    - name: "CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MIN_EXPIRED_ROWS_PER_PART"
      value: "100000"
```

### Setting `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MIN_EXPIRED_ROWS_PER_PART`
The job scans all parts, deleting data from parts which have a minimum number of expired rows.
The value of `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MIN_EXPIRED_ROWS_PER_PART` is used to determine how many expired rows should be in a part before it is considered for deletion.

If this value is set too low, the job loses effectiveness, as it will scan entire parts to clear little data. Set it too high, and the job will miss parts that have significant expired data.

A good query to run to check the expired rows in your tables is as such:
```sql
SELECT
    _part,
    count() AS expired_rows
FROM runs
WHERE trace_first_received_at IS NOT NULL
AND ttl_seconds IS NOT NULL
AND toDateTime(assumeNotNull(trace_first_received_at) + toIntervalSecond(assumeNotNull(ttl_seconds))) < now()
GROUP BY _part
ORDER BY expired_rows DESC
```

## Performance Considerations
This job uses Delete mutations (`ALTER TABLE DELETE`) to clean up tables. These are expensive operations that can impact system performance. Below are some tips to minimize system impact:
1. **<u>Single mutation recommendation</u>**: We recommend running only 1 delete mutation at a time. In our testing, we did not see significant CPU/memory/latency spikes with this approach.
2. **<u>Timing</u>**: Only run these queries during off-peak hours (nights and weekends) when you can handle increased system load.
3. **<u>Performance benchmarks</u>**: 
In our testing, a mutation scanning and deleting from a 100GB part took approximately 50 minutes when running a single mutation (no concurrency).

:::note NOTE
You can increase the number of concurrent delete operations through `CLICKHOUSE_TTL_CRON_MAX_ACTIVE_MUTATIONS` (default to 1). Please consider carefully before increasing.
