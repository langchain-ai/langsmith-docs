# Using an existing secret for your installation (Kubernetes only)

By default, LangSmith will provision several Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information such as license keys, salts, and other configuration parameters. However, you may want to use an existing secret that you have already created in your Kubernetes cluster (or provisioned via some sort of secrets operator).
This can be useful if you want to manage sensitive information in a centralized way or if you have specific security requirements.

By default we will provision the following secrets corresponding to different components of LangSmith:

- `langsmith-secrets`: This secret contains the license key and some other basic configuration parameters. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/secrets.yaml)
- `langsmith-redis`: This secret contains the Redis connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/redis/secrets.yaml)
- `langsmith-postgres`: This secret contains the Postgres connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/postgres/secrets.yaml)
- `langsmith-clickhouse`: This secret contains the ClickHouse connection string and password. You can see the template for this secret [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/templates/clickhouse/secrets.yaml)

## Requirements

- An existing Kubernetes cluster
- A way to create Kubernetes secrets in your cluster. This can be done using `kubectl`, a Helm chart, or a secrets operator like [Sealed Secrets](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets)

## Parameters

You will need to create your own Kubernetes secrets that adhere to the structure of the secrets provisioned by the LangSmith Helm Chart.

:::warning
The secrets must have the same structure as the ones provisioned by the LangSmith Helm Chart (refer to the links above to see the specific secrets). If you miss any of the required keys, your LangSmith instance may not work correctly.
:::

An example secret may look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: langsmith-existing-secrets
  namespace: langsmith
stringData:
  oauth_client_id: foo
  oauth_client_secret: foo
  oauth_issuer_url: foo
  langsmith_license_key: foo
  langgraph_cloud_license_key: foo
  api_key_salt: foo
  jwt_secret: foo
  initial_org_admin_password: foo
  blob_storage_access_key: foo
  blob_storage_access_key_secret: foo
  azure_storage_account_key: foo
  azure_storage_connection_string: foo
```

## Configuration

With these secrets provisioned, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use the secrets directly to avoid passing in secret values through plaintext. You can do this by modifying the `langsmith_config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    HelmBlock(`
config:
  existingSecretName: "langsmith-secrets" # The name of the secret that contains the license key and other basic configuration parameters
redis:
  external:
    enabled: true # Set to true to use an external Redis instance. This secret is only needed if you are using an external Redis instance
    existingSecretName: "langsmith-redis" # The name of the secret that contains the Redis connection string and password
postgres:
  external:
    enabled: true # Set to true to use an external Postgres instance. This secret is only needed if you are using an external Postgres instance
    existingSecretName: "langsmith-postgres" # The name of the secret that contains the Postgres connection string and password
clickhouse:
  external:
    enabled: true # Set to true to use an external ClickHouse instance. This secret is only needed if you are using an external ClickHouse instance
    existingSecretName: "langsmith-clickhouse" # The name of the secret that contains the ClickHouse connection string and password
`),
  ]}
/>

Once configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. You can follow our upgrade guide here: If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be accessible via the Ingress.
You can run the following to check that your secrets are being used correctly:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment langsmith-backend | grep -i <secret-name>
```

You should see something like this in the output:

```
POSTGRES_DATABASE_URI:                    <set to the key 'connection_url' in secret <your-secret-name>  Optional: false
CLICKHOUSE_DB:                            <set to the key 'clickhouse_db' in secret <your-secret-name>   Optional: false
```
