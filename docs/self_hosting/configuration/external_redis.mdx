# Connect to an external Redis database

LangSmith uses Redis to back our queuing/caching operations. By default, LangSmith Self-Hosted will use an internal Redis instance.
However, you can configure LangSmith to use an external Redis instance (**strongly recommended in a production setting**). By configuring an external Redis instance, you can more easily manage backups, scaling, and other operational tasks for your Redis instance.

## Requirements

- A provisioned Redis instance that your LangSmith instance will have network access to. We recommend using a managed Redis service like:
  - [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/)
  - [Google Cloud Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore)
  - [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cache/)
- Note: We only officially support Redis versions >= 5.
- We do not support Redis Cluster.
- By default, we recommend an instance with at least 2 vCPUs and 8GB of memory. However, the actual requirements will depend on your tracing workload. We recommend monitoring your Redis instance and scaling up as needed.

:::important Redis Cluster Not Supported
Certain tiers of managed Redis services may use Redis Cluster under the hood, but you can point to a single node in the cluster.
For example on Azure Cache for Redis, the `Premium` tier and above use Redis Cluster, so you will need to use a lower tier.

## Connection String

We use `redis-py` to connect to Redis. This library supports a variety of connection strings. You can find more information on the connection string format [here](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#redis.StrictRedis.from_url).

You will need to assemble the connection string for your Redis instance. This connection string should include the following information:

- Host
- Database
- Port
- URL params

This will take the form of:

```
"redis://host:port/db?<url_params>"
```

An example connection string might look like:

```
"redis://langsmith-redis:6379/0"
```

To use SSL, you can use the `rediss://` prefix. An example connection string with SSL might look like:

```
"rediss://langsmith-redis:6380/0?password=foo"
```

## Configuration

With your connection string in hand, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use an external Redis instance. You can do this by modifying the `values` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the `.env` file for your Docker installation.

<CodeTabs
  tabs={[
    HelmBlock(`
  redis:
    external:
      enabled: true
      connectionUrl: "Your connection url"
    `),
    DockerBlock(
      `# In your .env file
REDIS_DATABASE_URI="Your connection url"
    `
    ),
  ]}
/>

Once configured, you should be able to reinstall your LangSmith instance. If everything is configured correctly, your LangSmith instance should now be using your external Redis instance.
