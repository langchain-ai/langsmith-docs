# Using environment variables for model providers

Many model providers support setting credentials and other configuration options through environment variables. This is useful for self-hosted deployments where you want to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code or configuration files.
In LangSmith, most model interactions are done through the `playground` service, which allows you to configure many of those environment variables directly on the pod itself. This can be useful to avoid having to set credentials in the UI.

## Requirements

- A self-hosted LangSmith instance with the `playground` service running.
- The provider you want to configure must support environment variables for configuration. Check the provider's Chat Model [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/) for more information.
- The secrets/roles you may want to attach to the `playground` service.
  - Note that for IRSA you may need to grant the `langsmith-playground` service account the necessary permissions to access the secrets or roles in your cloud provider.

## Configuration

With the parameters from above, you can configure your LangSmith instance to use environment variables for model providers.
You can do this by modifying the `langsmith_config.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the `docker-compose.yaml` file for your Docker installation.
