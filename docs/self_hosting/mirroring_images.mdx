# Mirroring Images for your LangSmith installation

By default, LangSmith will pull images from our public Docker registry. However, if you are running LangSmith in an environment that does not have internet access, or if you would like to use a private Docker registry, you can mirror the images to your own registry and then configure your LangSmith installation to use those images.

## Requirements

- Authenticated access to a Docker registry that your Kubernetes cluster/machine has access to.
- Docker installed on your local machine or a machine that has access to the Docker registry.
- A Kubernetes cluster or a machine where you can run LangSmith.

## Mirroring the Images

For your convenience, we have provided a script that will mirror the images for you. You can find the script in the [LangSmith Helm Chart repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/scripts/mirror_langsmith_images.sh)

To use the script, you will need to run the script with the following command specifying your registry and platform:

```bash
bash mirror_images.sh <your-registry> [<platform>]
```

Where `<your-registry>` is the URL of your Docker registry (e.g. `myregistry.com`) and `<platform>` is the platform you are using (e.g. `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, etc.). If you do not specify a platform, it will default to `linux/amd64`.

For example, if your registry is `myregistry.com`, you would run:

```bash
bash mirror_langsmith_images.sh --registry myregistry --platform linux/arm64
```

Note that this script will assume that you have Docker installed and that you are authenticated to your registry. It will also push the images to the specified registry with the same repository/tag as the original images.

Alternatively, you can pull, mirror, and push the images manually. The images that you will need to mirror are found in the `values.yaml` file of the LangSmith Helm Chart.
These can be found here: [LangSmith Helm Chart values.yaml](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/values.yaml#L14)

Here is an example of how to mirror the images using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the images from the public registry
docker pull langchain/langsmith-backend:latest
docker tag langchain/langsmith-backend:latest <your-registry>/langsmith-backend:latest
docker push <your-registry>/langsmith-backend:latest
```

You will need to repeat this for each image that you want to mirror.

## Configuration

Once the images are mirrored, you will need to configure your LangSmith installation to use the mirrored images. You can do this by modifying the `values.yaml` file for your LangSmith Helm Chart installation or the `.env` file for your Docker installation.

    `
    ),
  ]}
/>

Once configured, you will need to update your LangSmith installation. You can follow our upgrade guide here: [Upgrading LangSmith](../upgrades).

If your upgrade is successful, your LangSmith instance should now be using the mirrored images from your Docker registry.
