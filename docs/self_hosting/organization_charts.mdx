# Viewing trace counts across your organization

:::note
This feature is available on Helm chart versions 0.8.21 and later.
:::

LangSmith automatically generates organization usage charts for self-hosted installations.

These charts are available under `Settings > Usage and billing > Usage graph`:

- Usage by Workspace: this counts traces (root runs) by workspace
- Organization Usage: this counts all traces (root runs) for the organization

The charts are refreshed to include any new workspaces every 5 minutes.
