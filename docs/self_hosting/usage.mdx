# Using your self-hosted instance of LangSmith

This guide will walk you through the process of using your self-hosted instance of LangSmith.

:::important Self-Hosted LangSmith Instance Required
This guide assumes you have already deployed a self-hosted LangSmith instance. If you have not, please refer to the [kubernetes deployment guide](/self_hosting/installation/kubernetes) or the [docker deployment guide](/self_hosting/installation/docker).
:::

### Configuring the application you want to use with LangSmith

LangSmith has two APIs: One for interacting with the LangChain Hub/prompts and one for interacting with the backend of the LangSmith application. Each exists at its own URL and in a self-hosted environment are set via the `LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_URL` and `LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT` environment variables, respectively, and have their own separate SDKs.

1. Once you have deployed your instance, you can access the LangSmith UI at `http://<host>`.
2. The backend API will be available at `http://<host>/api`

To use the LangSmith API, you will need to set the following environment variables in your application:

```bash
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT=http://<host>/api
LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_URL=http://<host>/api # Only set this if using the legacy langchainhub SDK
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=foo # Set to a legitimate API key if using OAuth
```

You can also configure these variables directly in the LangSmith SDK client:

```python
import langsmith

langsmith_client = langsmith.Client(
    api_key='<api_key>',
    api_url='http://<host>/api',
)

# Deprecated, you can use the Langsmith client for all interactions
import langchainhub

# Deprecated, use langsmith.Client instead
langchainhub.Client(
    api_key='<api_key>',
    api_url='http://<host>/api'
)
```

After setting the above, you should be able to run your code and see the results in your self-hosted instance.
We recommend running through the [<u>quickstart guide</u>](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/#quick-start) to get a feel for how to use LangSmith.
