# Exporting LangSmith telemetry to your observability backend

:::warning Important
**This section is only applicable for Kubernetes deployments.**
:::

Self-Hosted LangSmith instances produce telemetry data in the form of logs, metrics and traces. This section will show you how to access and export that data to
an observability collector or backend.

This section assumes that you have monitoring infrastructure set up already, or you will set up this infrastructure and want to know how to configure LangSmith to collect data from it.

Infrastructure refers to:

- Collectors, such as [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), [FluentBit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual) or [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
- Observability backends, such as [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) or the [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) ecosystem.

# Logs: [OTel Example](./langsmith_collector#logs)

All services that are part of the LangSmith self-hosted deployment write logs to their node's filesystem. In order to access these logs, you need to set up your collector to read from those files. Most popular collectors support reading logs from filesystems.

- **OpenTelemetry**: [File Log Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver)
- **FluentBit**: [Tail Input](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/inputs/tail)
- **Datadog**: [Kubernetes Log Collection](https://docs.datadoghq.com/containers/kubernetes/log/?tab=datadogoperator)

# Metrics: [OTel Example](./langsmith_collector#metrics)

    ## LangSmith Services
    The following LangSmith services expose metrics at an endpoint, in the Prometheus metrics format.
    - <b>Backend</b>: `http://langsmith-backend.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:1984/metrics`
    - <b>Platform Backend</b>: `http://langsmith-platform-backend.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:1986/metrics`
    - <b>Host Backend</b>: `http://langsmith-host-backend.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:1985/metrics`
    - <b>Playground</b>: `http://langsmith-playground.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:1988/metrics`

    You can use a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configure-prometheus-to-monitor-the-sample-targets) or
    [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) collector to scrape the endpoints, and export metrics to the
    backend of your choice.
    
    ## Frontend Nginx
    The frontend service exposes its Nginx metrics at the following endpoint: `langsmith-frontend.langsmith.svc.cluster.local:80/nginx_status`. You can either scrape them yourself, or 
    bring up a Prometheus Nginx exporter using the [LangSmith Observability Helm Chart](./observability_stack)

    :::warning Important
    **The following sections apply for in-cluster databases only. If you are using external databases, you will need to configure exposing and fetching metrics.**
    :::
    ## Postgres + Redis
    If you are using in-cluster Postgres/Redis instances, you can use a Prometheus exporter to expose metrics from your instance. You can deploy your own, or if you would like, you can
    use the [LangSmith Observability Helm Chart](./observability_stack) to deploy an exporter for you. You will need to point your exporters to:
    - **Redis**: `langsmith-redis.<namespace>svc.cluster.local:6379`
    - **Postgres**`langsmith-postgres.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:5432`

    ## Clickhouse
    The in-cluster Clickhouse is configured to expose metrics without the need for an exporter.
    You can use your collector to scrape metrics at `http://langsmith-clickhouse.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:9363/metrics`

# Traces: [OTel Example](./langsmith_collector#traces)

The LangSmith Backend, Platform Backend, Playground and LangSmith Queue deployments have been instrumented to emit [Otel](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/)
traces. Tracing is toggled off by default, and can be enabled with the following in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
config:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    endpoint: "<your_collector_endpoint>"
    useTls: true # / false
    env: "ls_self_hosted" # This value will be set as an "env" attribute in your spans
    exporter: "http" # must be either http or grpc
```

This will export traces from all LangSmith backend services to the specified endpoint.
