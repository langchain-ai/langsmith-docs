# Generating Clickhouse Stats

As part of troubleshooting your self-hosted instance of LangSmith, the LangChain team may ask you to generate Clickhouse statistics that will help us understand memory and CPU consumption and connection concurrency.

This command will generate a CSV that can be shared with the LangChain team.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools/items ready.

1. kubectl

   - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

2. Clickhouse database credentials

   - Host
   - Port
   - Username
     - If using the bundled version, this is `default`
   - Password
     - If using the bundled version, this is `password`
   - Database name
     - If using the bundled version, this is `default`

3. Connectivity to the Clickhouse database from the machine you will be running the `get_clickhouse_stats` script on.

   - If you are using the bundled version, you may need to port forward the clickhouse service to your local machine.
   - Run `kubectl port-forward svc/langsmith-clickhouse 8123:8123` to port forward the clickhouse service to your local machine.

4. The script to generate ClickHouse stats

   - You can download the script from [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/scripts/get_clickhouse_stats.sh)

### Running the clickhouse stats generation script

Run the following command to run the stats generation script:

```bash
sh get_clickhouse_stats.sh <clickhouse_url> --output path/to/file.csv
```

For example, if you are using the bundled version with port-forwarding, the command would look like:

```bash
sh get_clickhouse_stats.sh "clickhouse://default:password@localhost:8123/default" --output clickhouse_stats.csv
```

and after running this command you should see a file, clickhouse_stats.csv, has been created with Clickhouse statistics.
