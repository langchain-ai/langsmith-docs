# Running Support Queries against Postgres

This Helm repository contains queries to produce output that the LangSmith UI does not currently support directly (e.g. obtaining trace counts for multiple organizations in a single query).

This command takes a postgres connection string that contains an embedded name and password (which can be passed in from a call to a secrets manager) and executes a query from an input file. In the example below, we are using the `pg_get_trace_counts_daily.sql` input file in the `support_queries/postgres` directory.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools/items ready.

1. kubectl

   - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/

2. PostgreSQL client

   - https://www.postgresql.org/download/

3. PostgreSQL database connection:

   - Host
   - Port
   - Username
     - If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`
   - Password
     - If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`
   - Database name
     - If using the bundled version, this is `postgres`

4. Connectivity to the PostgreSQL database from the machine you will be running the migration script on.

   - If you are using the bundled version, you may need to port forward the postgresql service to your local machine.
   - Run `kubectl port-forward svc/langsmith-postgres 5432:5432` to port forward the postgresql service to your local machine.

5. The script to run a support query

   - You can download the script from [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/scripts/run_support_query_pg.sh)

### Running the query script

Run the following command to run the desired query:

```bash
sh run_support_query_pg.sh <postgres_url> --input path/to/query.sql
```

For example, if you are using the bundled version with port-forwarding, the command might look like:

```bash
sh run_support_query_pg.sh "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres" --input support_queries/pg_get_trace_counts_daily.sql
```

which will output the count of daily traces by workspace ID and organization ID. To extract this to a file add the flag `--output path/to/file.csv`
