# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is LangChain Hub?

[LangChain Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub) lets you discover, version control, and experiment with different prompts for LangChain and LLMs in general directly in your browser.

### How do I share a private prompt with my teammates?

You can share prompts within a LangSmith organization by uploading them within a shared organization.

First, create an API key for your organization, then set the variable in your development environment:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY = "ls__.."
```

Then, you can upload prompts to the organization. Assuming your organization's handle is "my-organization":

```python
from langchain import hub

prompt = ...
hub.push("my-organization/my-prompt-name", prompt, new_repo_is_public=False)
```

Now, all your team-members within your LangSmith organization will be able to view, pull, and open the prompt in the playground.

### Why can't I push anything other than prompts?

Hub currently only supports LangChain prompt objects. We are working on adding support for more!

### Can I upload a prompt to the hub from a LangSmith Trace?
