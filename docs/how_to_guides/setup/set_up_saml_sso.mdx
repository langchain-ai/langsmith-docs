# SAML SSO

Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality is available for Enterprise customers to access LangSmith through a single authentication source. This allows administrators to centrally manage team access and keeps information more secure.

LangSmith's SSO configuration is built using the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) 2.0 standard. SAML 2.0 enables connecting an Identity Provider (IdP) to your organization for an easier, more secure login experience.

:::note
SAML SSO is available for organizations on the [Enterprise plan](../../pricing.mdx). Please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.
:::

## What is SAML SSO?

SSO services permit a user to use one set of credentials (for example, a name or email address and password) to access multiple applications. The service authenticates the end user only once for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

## Benefits of SSO

- Streamlines user management across systems for organization owners.
- Enables organizations to enforce their own security policies (e.g. MFA)
- Removes the need for end-users to remember and manage multiple passwords. Simplifies end-users experience by allowing them to sign in at one single access point and enjoy a seamless experience across multiple applications.

## Set up SAML SSO for your organization

### Prerequisites

- Your organization must be on an Enterprise plan
- Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support the SAML 2.0 standard
- Only [Organization Admins](../../concepts/admin#organization-roles) can configure SAML SSO

### Initial configuration

:::note
See IdP-specific instructions [below](#identity-provider-idp-setup)
:::note

:::note
The URLs are different for the US and EU. Please make sure to select your region from the dropdown in the top right.
:::

1. In your IdP: Configure a SAML application with the following details, then copy the metadata URL or XML for step 3 below
   1. Single sign-on URL a.k.a. ACS URL: <RegionalUrl type='auth' suffix='/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs'/>
   1. Audience URI a.k.a. SP Entity ID: <RegionalUrl type='auth' suffix='/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata'/>
   1. Name ID format: email address
   1. Application username: email address
   1. Required claims: `sub` and `email`
1. In LangSmith: Go to `Settings` -> `Members and roles` -> `SSO Configuration`
   1. Fill in the required information and submit to activate SSO login
      1. Fill in either the `SAML metadata URL` or `SAML metadata XML`
      1. Select the `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces`.
         New users logging in via SSO will be added to the specified workspaces with the selected role.

### Editing SAML SSO settings

- `Default workspace role` and `Default workspaces` are editable.
  The updated settings will apply to new users only, not existing users.
- (Coming soon) `SAML metadata URL` and `SAML metadata XML` are editable. This is usually only necessary when cryptographic keys are rotated/expired or the metadata URL has changed but the same IdP is still used.

## Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning

LangSmith supports Just-in-Time provisioning when using SAML SSO. This allows someone signing in via SAML SSO to join the organization and selected workspaces automatically as a member.

:::note
JIT provisioning only runs for new users i.e. users who do not already have access to the organization with the same email address via a [different login method](../../reference/authentication_authorization/authentication_methods.mdx#cloud)
:::

## Login methods and access

Once you have completed your configuration of SAML SSO for your organization, users will be able to login via SAML SSO in addition to [other login methods](../../reference/authentication_authorization/authentication_methods.mdx#cloud) such as username/password and Google Authentication.

- When logged in via SAML SSO, users can only access the corresponding organization with SAML SSO configured.
- Users with SAML SSO as their only login method do not have [personal organizations](../../concepts/admin/admin.mdx#organizations)
- When logged in via any other method, users can access the organization with SAML SSO configured along with any other organizations they are a part of

## Enforce SAML SSO only

To ensure users can only access the organization when logged in using SAML SSO and no other method, check the `Login via SSO only` checkbox and click `Save`.
Once this happens, users accessing the organization that are logged-in via a non-SSO login method are required to log back in using SAML SSO.  
This setting can be switched back to allow all login methods by unselecting the checkbox and clicking `Save`.

:::note
You must be logged in via SAML SSO in order to update this setting to `Only SAML SSO`.
This is to ensure the SAML settings are valid and avoid locking users out of your organization.

If you have issues setting up SAML SSO, please reach out to [support@langchain.dev](mailto:support@langchain.dev).

### FAQ

#### _How do I change a SAML SSO user's email address?_

Some identity providers retain the original `User ID` through an email change while others do not, so we recommend that you follow these steps to avoid duplicate users in LangSmith:

1. Remove the user from the organization (see [here](../setup/set_up_organization.mdx#manage-users))
1. Change their email address in the IdP
1. Have them login to LangSmith again via SAML SSO - this will trigger the usual [JIT provisioning](#just-in-time-jit-provisioning) flow with their new email address

#### _How do I fix "405 method not allowed"?_

Ensure you're using the correct ACS URL: <RegionalUrl type='auth' suffix='/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs'/>
