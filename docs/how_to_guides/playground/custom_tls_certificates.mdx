# Use custom TLS certificates

:::note Self-hosted enterprise only (version 0.6 and later)

This feature is only available for self-hosted enterprise customers, starting from version 0.6.

If you are interested in this plan, please contact sales@langchain.dev for more information.

:::

:::note Azure OpenAI only

This feature is currently only available for the Azure OpenAI model provider. More model providers will be supported in the future.

This will currently only affect model invocations through the **LangSmith Playground**, not [**Online Evaluation**](../monitoring/online_evaluations).
The TLS certificates will apply to all Azure Deployment configurations in the playground.

:::

You can use custom TLS certificates to connect to model providers in the LangSmith playground. This is useful if you are using a self-signed certificate, a certificate from a custom certificate authority or mutual TLS authentication.

To use custom TLS certificates, you need to set the following environment variables. See the [self hosted deployment section](/self_hosting) for more information on how to set up application configuration.

- `LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_MODEL_PROVIDERS`: A comma-separated list of model providers that require custom TLS certificates. Note that `azure_openai` is currently the only supported model provider that supports custom TLS certificates, but more providers will be supported in the future.
- `LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_CA`: The custom certificate authority (CA) certificate in PEM format. This can be a file path (for a mounted volume) or a base64-encoded string.
- [Optional] `LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_KEY`: The private key in PEM format. This can be a file path (for a mounted volume) or a base64-encoded string. This is usually only necessary for mutual TLS authentication.
- [Optional] `LANGSMITH_PLAYGROUND_TLS_CERT`: The certificate in PEM format. This can be a file path (for a mounted volume) or a base64-encoded string. This is usually only necessary for mutual TLS authentication.

Once you have set these environment variables, enter the playground and select the `AzureChatOpenAI` model provider.

Enter the `Deployment Name`, `Azure Endpoint`, and `API Version`, as well as model invocation parameters. Then, the playground will be able to connect to the model provider using the custom TLS certificate.
