# Trace query syntax

Using the `list_runs` method in the SDK or `/runs/query` endpoint in the API, you can filter runs to analyze and export.

## Filter arguments

| `run_type`                    | The type of run to get, such as `llm`, `chain`, `tool`, `retriever`, etc.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `dataset_name` / `dataset_id` | Fetch runs that are associated with an example row in the specified dataset. This is useful for comparing prompts or models over a given dataset.                                                                              |

| `run_ids`                     | Fetch runs with a given list of run ids. Note: **This will ignore all other filtering arguments.**                                                                                                                             |
| `filter`                      | Fetch runs that match a given structured filter statement. See the guide below for more information.                                                                                                                           |
| `trace_filter`                | Filter to apply to the ROOT run in the trace tree. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the regular `filter` parameter to let you filter runs by attributes of the root run within a trace.                            |
| `tree_filter`                 | Filter to apply to OTHER runs in the trace tree, including sibling and child runs. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the regular `filter` parameter to let you filter runs by attributes of any run within a trace. |
| `is_root`                     | Only return root runs.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `select`                      | Select the fields to return in the response. By default, all fields are returned.                                                                                                                                              |
| `query` (_experimental_)      | Natural language query, which translates your query into a filter statement.                                                                                                                                                   |

## Filter query language

LangSmith supports powerful filtering capabilities with a filter query language to permit complex filtering operations when fetching runs.

The filtering grammar is based on common comparators on fields in the run object. Supported comparators include:

- `gte` (greater than or equal to)
- `gt` (greater than)
- `lte` (less than or equal to)
- `lt` (less than)
- `eq` (equal to)
- `neq` (not equal to)
- `has` (check if run contains a tag or metadata json blob)
- `search` (search for a substring in a string field)

Additionally, you can combine multiple comparisons through `and` and `or` operators.

These can be applied on fields of the run object, such as its `id`, `name`, `run_type`, `start_time` / `end_time`, `latency`, `total_tokens`, `error`, `execution_order`, `tags`, and any associated feedback through `feedback_key` and `feedback_score`.
