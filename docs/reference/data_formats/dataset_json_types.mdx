# Dataset JSON Schema Types
LangSmith recommends that you set a schema on the inputs and outputs of your dataset schemas. 

In order to better support LLM workflows, LangSmith has support for a few different predefined custom types. These 
schemas are hosted publicly by the LangSmith API, and can be defined in your dataset schemas using 
[JSON Schema references](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring#dollarref). The table
of available schemas can be seen below

LangSmith lets you define a series of transformations that collect the above custom types from your traces and add them to your
dataset. For more info on available transformations, see our [reference](./dataset_transformations.mdx)
