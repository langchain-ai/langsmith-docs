**Feedback** is LangSmith's way of storing the criteria and scores from evaluation on a particular trace or intermediate run (span).
Feedback can be produced from a variety of ways, such as:

1. [Sent up along with a trace](../../how_to_guides/human_feedback/attach_user_feedback) from the LLM application
2. Generated by a user in the app [inline](../../how_to_guides/human_feedback/annotate_traces_inline) or in an [annotation queue](../../how_to_guides/human_feedback/annotation_queues)
3. Generated by an automatic evaluator during [offline evaluation](../../how_to_guides/evaluation/evaluate_llm_application)
4. Generated by an [online evaluator](../../how_to_guides/monitoring/online_evaluations)

Feedback is stored in a simple format with the following fields:

| Field Name               | Type     | Description                                                                                            |

| session_id               | UUID     | Unique identifier for the experiment or tracing project the run was a part of                          |
| run_id                   | UUID     | Unique identifier for a specific run within a session                                                  |
| key                      | string   | A key describing the criteria of the feedback, eg "correctness"                                        |
| score                    | number   | Numerical score associated with the feedback key                                                       |
| value                    | string   | Reserved for storing a value associated with the score. Useful for categorical feedback.               |
| comment                  | string   | Any comment or annotation associated with the record. This can be a justification for the score given. |
| correction               | object   | Reserved for storing correction details, if any                                                        |
| feedback_source          | object   | Object containing information about the feedback source                                                |
| feedback_source.type     | string   | The type of source where the feedback originated, eg "api", "app", "evaluator"                         |
| feedback_source.metadata | object   | Reserved for additional metadata, currently                                                            |
| feedback_source.user_id  | UUID     | Unique identifier for the user providing feedback                                                      |
