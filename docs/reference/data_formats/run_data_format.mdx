:::

LangSmith stores and processes trace data in a simple format that is easy to export and import.

Many of these fields are optional or not important to know about but are included for completeness.
The **bolded** fields are the most important ones to know about.

| Field Name                   | Type             | Description                                                                                                    |

#### What is `dotted_order`?

A run's dotted order is a sortable key that fully specifies its location within the tracing hierarchy.

Take the following example:

```python
import langsmith as ls


@ls.traceable
def grandchild():
    p("grandchild")


@ls.traceable
def child():
    grandchild()


@ls.traceable
def parent():
    child()
```

If you print out the IDs at each stage, you may get the following:

```text
parent
	run_id=0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
	trace_id=0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
  parent_run_id=null
	dotted_order=20240919T171648521691Z0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
child
	run_id=a8024e23-5b82-47fd-970e-f6a5ba3f5097
	trace_id=0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
  parent_run_id=0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
	dotted_order=20240919T171648521691Z0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7.20240919T171648523407Za8024e23-5b82-47fd-970e-f6a5ba3f5097
grandchild
	run_id=0ec6b845-18b9-4aa1-8f1b-6ba3f9fdefd6
	trace_id=0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7
  parent_run_id=a8024e23-5b82-47fd-970e-f6a5ba3f5097
	dotted_order=20240919T171648521691Z0e01bf50-474d-4536-810f-67d3ee7ea3e7.20240919T171648523407Za8024e23-5b82-47fd-970e-f6a5ba3f5097.20240919T171648523563Z0ec6b845-18b9-4aa1-8f1b-6ba3f9fdefd6
```

Note a few invariants:

- The "id" is equal to the last 36 characters of the dotted order (the suffix after the final "Z"). See `0ec6b845-18b9-4aa1-8f1b-6ba3f9fdefd6` for example in the grandchild.
- The "trace_id" is equal to the first UUID in the dotted order (i.e., `dotted_order.split('.')[0].split('Z')[1]`)
- If "parent_run_id" exists, it is the penultimate UUID in the dotted order. See `a8024e23-5b82-47fd-970e-f6a5ba3f5097` in the grandchild, for an example.
- If you split the dotted_order on the dots, each segment is formatted as (`<run_start_time>Z<run_id>`)
