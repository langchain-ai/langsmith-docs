LangSmith stores examples in datasets as follows:

| Field Name        | Type     | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **id**            | UUID     | Unique identifier for the example.                                                          |
| **name**          | string   | The name of the example.                                                                    |
| \*\*created_at    | datetime | The time this example was created                                                           |
| \*\*modified_at   | datetime | The last time this example was modified                                                     |
| **inputs**        | object   | A map of inputs for the example.                                                            |
