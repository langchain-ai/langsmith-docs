# Authentication methods

LangSmith supports multiple authentication methods for easy sign-up and login.

## Cloud

### Email/Password

Users can use an email address and password to sign up and login to LangSmith.

### Social Providers

Users can alternatively use their credentials from GitHub, Google, or Discord.

### SAML SSO

Enterprise customers can configure [SAML SSO](/administration/how_to_guides/organization_management/set_up_saml_sso.mdx)

## Self-Hosted

Self-hosted customers have more control over how their users can login to LangSmith.
For more in-depth coverage of configuration options, see [the self-hosting docs](../../self_hosting)
and [Helm chart](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/tree/main/charts/langsmith).

### SSO with OAuth 2.0 and OIDC

Production installations should configure SSO in order to use an external identity provider.
This enables users to login through an identity platform like Auth0/Okta. LangSmith supports almost any OIDC-compliant provider.
Learn more about configuring SSO in the [SSO configuration guide](../../self_hosting/configuration/sso)

### Email/Password a.k.a. basic auth {#basic-auth}

This auth method requires very little configuration as it does not require an external identity provider.
It is most appropriate to use for self-hosted trials. Learn more in the [basic auth configuration guide](../../self_hosting/configuration/basic_auth)

### None

:::warning
This authentication mode will be removed after the launch of Basic Auth.
:::

If zero authentication methods are enabled, a self-hosted installation does not require any login/sign-up.
This configuration should only be used for verifying installation at the infrastructure level, as the feature set
supported in this mode is restricted with only a single organization and workspace.
