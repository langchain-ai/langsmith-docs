# SCIM User Provisioning (Beta)

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that allows for the automation of user provisioning. Using SCIM, you can automatically provision and deprovision users in your LangSmith organization and workspaces, keeping user access synchronized with your organization's identity provider.

:::note
SCIM is available for organizations on the [Enterprise plan](https://www.langchain.com/pricing). Please [contact sales](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.

While in Beta, SCIM support is API-only (see instructions below).
:::

## What is SCIM?

SCIM enables automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning between your identity provider (IdP) and LangSmith. This eliminates the need for manual user management and ensures that user access is always up-to-date with your organization's identity system.

## Benefits of SCIM

- **Automated user management**: Users are automatically added, updated, and removed from LangSmith based on their status in your IdP
- **Reduced administrative overhead**: No need to manually manage user access across multiple systems
- **Improved security**: Users who leave your organization are automatically deprovisioned from LangSmith
- **Consistent access control**: User attributes and group memberships are synchronized between systems
- **Scalable**: Efficiently manage large teams with many workspaces and custom roles

## Prerequisites

- Your organization must be on an Enterprise plan
- Your Identity Provider (IdP) must support SCIM 2.0
- Only [Organization Admins](../../concepts#organization-roles) can configure SCIM
- For cloud customers: [SAML SSO](./set_up_saml_sso.mdx) must be configured for your organization
- For self-hosted customers: [OAuth with Client Secret](../../../self_hosting/configuration/sso#with-secret) authentication mode must be enabled

## Capabilities

SCIM enables the following capabilities:

- **User provisioning**: Automatically add users to your LangSmith organization
- **User deprovisioning**: Automatically remove users from your organization
- **Attribute synchronization**: Keep user attributes (like full name) synchronized between your IdP and LangSmith
- **Group-based access**: Sync membership from IdP user groups to LangSmith workspaces
- **Role assignment**: Select specific [Organization Roles](../../concepts#organization-roles) and [Workspace Roles](../../concepts#workspace-roles) for groups of users

## Role Precedence

When a user belongs to multiple groups for the same workspace, the following precedence applies:

1. **Organization Admin groups** take highest precedence - users in these groups will be `Admin` in all workspaces
2. **Most recently-created workspace-specific group** takes precedence over other workspace groups

:::note
When a group is deleted or a user is removed from a group, their access is updated according to their remaining group membership, following the precedence rules above.

SCIM group membership will override manually-assigned roles or roles assigned via Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning to avoid conflicts.
:::

## Group Naming Convention

Group membership maps to LangSmith Workspace membership and workspace roles with a specific naming convention:

### Organization Admin Groups

- `LS:Organization Admin` or `LS:Organization Admins`

### Workspace-Specific Groups

Format: `LS:<org_role_name>:<workspace_name>:<workspace_role_name>`

Examples:

- `LS:Organization User:Production:Annotators`
- `LS:Organization User:Engineering:Developers`
- `LS:Organization User:Marketing:Viewers`

## Set up SCIM for your organization

### Step 1: Configure SAML SSO (Cloud only)

If you're using LangSmith Cloud, ensure [SAML SSO](./set_up_saml_sso.mdx) is configured for your organization.

### Step 2: Disable JIT Provisioning (Cloud only)

Before enabling SCIM, disable [Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning](./set_up_saml_sso.mdx#just-in-time-jit-provisioning) to prevent conflicts between automatic and manual user provisioning. Use the `PATCH /orgs/current/info` <RegionalUrl
    text="endpoint"
    type="api"
    suffix="/redoc#tag/orgs/operation/update_current_organization_info_api_v1_orgs_current_info_patch"
  />

### Step 3: Generate SCIM Bearer Token

Generate a SCIM Bearer Token for your organization. This token will be used by your IdP to authenticate SCIM API requests.
Ensure env vars are set appropriately, for example:

```shell
curl -X POST $LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT/v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $LANGCHAIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $LANGCHAIN_ORGANIZATION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Your description here"}'
```

Note that the SCIM Bearer Token value is not available outside of the response to this request.
These additional endpoints are present:

- `GET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens`
- `GET /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}`
- `PATCH /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}` (only the `description` field is supported)
- `DELETE /v1/platform/orgs/current/scim/tokens/{scim_token_id}`

### Step 4: Configure your Identity Provider

Follow the IdP-specific instructions below to configure SCIM integration.

## Identity Provider (IdP) Setup

### Azure Entra ID

For additional information, see Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/app-provisioning/user-provisioning).

**Step 1: Configure SCIM in your Enterprise Application**

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) with a privileged role (e.g. Global Administrator)
2. Navigate to your existing LangSmith Enterprise Application
3. In the left-side navigation, select `Manage > Provisioning`
4. Click `Get started`

**Step 2: Configure Admin Credentials**

1. Under `Admin Credentials`:
   - **Tenant URL**: `https://api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2` (or `https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com/scim/v2` if in EU)
   - **Secret Token**: Enter the SCIM Bearer Token generated in Step 3 above
2. Click `Test Connection` to verify the configuration
3. Click `Save`

**Step 3: Configure Attribute Mappings**

Configure the following attribute mappings under `Mappings`:

**User Attributes**

Set `Target Object Actions` to `Create` and `Update` (start with `Delete` disabled for safety):

| **LangSmith App Attribute**    | **Microsoft Entra ID Attribute**                                 | **Matching Precedence** |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `userName`                     | `userPrincipalName`                                              |                         |
| `active`                       | `Not([IsSoftDeleted])`                                           |                         |
| `emails[type eq "work"].value` | `mail`<sup>1</sup>                                               |                         |
| `name.formatted`               | `displayName` OR `Join(" ", [givenName], [surname])`<sup>2</sup> |                         |
| `externalId`                   | `objectId`                                                       | 1                       |

1.  User's email address must be present in Entra ID
2.  Use the `Join` expression if your `displayName` does not match the format of `Firstname Lastname`

**Group Attributes**

Set `Target Object Actions` to `Create` and `Update` only (start with `Delete` disabled for safety):

| **LangSmith App Attribute** | **Microsoft Entra ID Attribute** | **Matching Precedence** |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `displayName`               | `displayname`<sup>1</sup>        | 1                       |
| `externalId`                | `objectId`                       |                         |
| `members`                   | `members`                        |                         |

1. Groups must follow the naming convention described in the [Azure Group Naming Convention](#group-naming-convention) section

**Step 4: Assign Users and Groups**

1. Under `Applications > Applications`, select your LangSmith Enterprise Application
2. Under the `Assignments` tab, click `Assign` then either `Assign to People` or `Assign to Groups`
3. Make the desired selection(s), then `Assign` and `Done`

**Step 5: Enable Provisioning**

1. Set `Provisioning Status` to `On` under `Provisioning`
2. Monitor the initial sync to ensure users and groups are provisioned correctly
3. Once verified, enable `Delete` actions for both User and Group mappings

### FAQ

#### _Can I use SCIM without SAML SSO?_

- **Cloud**: No, SAML SSO is required for SCIM in cloud deployments
- **Self-hosted**: Yes, SCIM works with OAuth with Client Secret authentication mode

#### _What happens if I have both JIT provisioning and SCIM enabled?_

JIT provisioning and SCIM can conflict with each other. We recommend disabling JIT provisioning before enabling SCIM to ensure consistent user provisioning behavior.

#### _How do I change a user's role or workspace access?_

Update the user's group membership in your IdP. The changes will be synchronized to LangSmith according to the [role precedence rules](#role-precedence).

#### _What happens when a user is removed from all groups?_

The user will be deprovisioned from your LangSmith organization according to your IdP's deprovisioning settings.

#### _Can I use custom group names?_

No, groups must follow the specific naming convention described in the [Group Naming Convention](#group-naming-convention) section to properly map to LangSmith roles and workspaces.
