# Set a sampling rate for traces

:::note
This section is relevant for those using the LangSmith SDK or LangChain, not for those logging directly with the LangSmith API.
:::

## Set global sampling rate

By default, all traces are logged to LangSmith.
To down-sample the number of traces logged to LangSmith, set the `LANGSMITH_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE` environment variable to
any float between `0` (no traces) and `1` (all traces).
For instance, setting the following environment variable will log 75% of the traces.

```bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING_SAMPLING_RATE=0.75
```

This works for the `traceable` decorator and `RunTree` objects.

## Setting different sampling rates per client

You can also set sampling rates on specific `Client` instances and using the `tracing_context` context manager:

```python
from langsmith import Client, tracing_context

# Create clients with different sampling rates
client_1 = Client(tracing_sampling_rate=0.5)  # 50% sampling
client_2 = Client(tracing_sampling_rate=0.25)  # 25% sampling
client_no_trace = Client(tracing_sampling_rate=0.0)  # No tracing

# Use different sampling rates for different operations
with tracing_context(client=client_1):
    # Your code here - will be traced with 50% sampling rate
    agent_1.invoke(...)

with tracing_context(client=client_2):
    # Your code here - will be traced with 25% sampling rate
    agent_1.invoke(...)

with tracing_context(client=client_no_trace):
    # Your code here - will not be traced
    agent_1.invoke(...)
```

This allows you to control sampling rates at the operation level.
