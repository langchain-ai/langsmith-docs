# Trace JS functions in serverless environments

:::note
This section is relevant for those using the LangSmith JS SDK version 0.2.0 and higher.
If you are tracing using LangChain.js or LangGraph.js in serverless environments, see [this guide](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/callbacks_serverless).
:::

When tracing JavaScript functions, LangSmith will trace runs in the background by default to avoid adding latency.
In serverless environments where the execution context may be terminated abruptly, it's important to ensure that all tracing data is properly flushed before the function completes.

To make sure this occurs, you can either:

- Set an environment variable named `LANGSMITH_TRACING_BACKGROUND` to `"false"`. This will cause your traced functions to wait for tracing to complete before returning.
  - Note that this is named differently from the [environment variable](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/callbacks_serverless) in LangChain.js because LangSmith can be used without LangChain.
- Pass a custom client into your traced runs and `await` the `client.awaitPendingTraceBatches();` method.

Here's an example of using `awaitPendingTraceBatches` alongside the [`traceable`](/observability/how_to_guides/tracing/annotate_code) method:

```ts
import { Client } from "langsmith";
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";

const langsmithClient = new Client({});

const tracedFn = traceable(
  async () => {
    return "Some return value";
  },
  {
    client: langsmithClient,
  }
);

const res = await tracedFn();

await langsmithClient.awaitPendingTraceBatches();
```
