# How to print out logs from the langsmith python package

The LangSmith package uses python's built in [`logging`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) mechanism to output logs
about its behavior to standard output.

## Ensure logging is configured

If logging is not currently configured for your python environment, you'll need to explicitly turn it on as follows:

<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`
import logging
# Note: this will affect _all_ packages that use python's built-in logging mechanism, 
#       so may increase your log volume. Pick the right log level for your use case.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)
    `),
  ]}
/>

## Increase the logger's verbosity

When debugging an issue, it's helpful to increase logs to a higher level verbosity so more info is
outputted to the console. You can set the level to `INFO` or `DEBUG` to get more logs as follows:

<CodeTabs
  groupId="client-language"
  tabs={[
    PythonBlock(`
import langsmith
import logging

# Loggers are hierarchical, so setting the log level on "langsmith" will

# set it on all modules inside the "langsmith" package

langsmith_logger = logging.getLogger("langsmith")
langsmith_logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
`),
]}
/>
