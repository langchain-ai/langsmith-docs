# Upload files with traces

:::tip Recommended Reading
Before diving into this content, it would be helpful to read the following guides:

- [Trace with LangSmith using the traceable decorator or wrapper](./annotate_code/#use-traceable--traceable)
  :::

:::note Minimum SDK Versions
The following features are available in the following SDK versions:

- Python SDK: >=0.1.141
- JS/TS SDK: >=0.2.5
  :::

LangSmith supports uploading binary files (such as images, audio, videos, PDFs, and CSVs) with your traces. This is particularly useful when working with LLM pipelines using multimodal inputs or outputs.

In both the Python and TypeScript SDKs, attachments can be added to your traces by specifying the MIME type and binary content of each file.
This guide explains how to define and trace attachments using the `Attachment` type in Python and `Uint8Array` / `ArrayBuffer` in TypeScript.

      `In the Python SDK, you can use the \`Attachment\` type to add files to your traces.
Each \`Attachment\` requires:\n

- \`mime_type\` (str): The MIME type of the file (e.g., \`"image/png"\`).
- \`data\` (bytes): The binary content of the file.\n
  Simply decorate a function with \`@traceable\` and include your \`Attachment\` instances as arguments.`),

  `In the TypeScript SDK, you can add attachments to traces by using \`Uint8Array\` or \`ArrayBuffer\` as data types.
  Each attachment's MIME type is specified within \`extractAttachments\`:\n\n
- \`Uint8Array\`: Useful for handling binary data directly.
- \`ArrayBuffer\`: Represents fixed-length binary data, which can be converted to \`Uint8Array\` as needed.\n
  Wrap your function with \`traceable\` and include your attachments within the \`extractAttachments\` option.\n
  In the TypeScript SDK, the \`extractAttachments\` function is an optional parameter in the \`traceable\` configuration. When the traceable-wrapped function is invoked, it extracts binary data (e.g., images, audio files) from your inputs and logs them alongside other trace data, specifying their MIME types.\n
  \`\`\`
  type AttachmentData = Uint8Array | ArrayBuffer;
  type Attachments = Record<string, [string, AttachmentData]>;\n

  ...args: Parameters<Func>

Here is how the above would look in the LangSmith UI. You can expand each attachment to view its contents.
