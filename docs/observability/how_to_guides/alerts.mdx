# Alerts in LangSmith

:::note Self-hosted Version Requirement
Access to alerts requires Helm chart version version **0.10** or later.

## Overview

Effective observability in LLM applications requires proactive detection of failures, performance degradations, and regressions. LangSmith's alerts feature helps identify critical issues such as:

- API rate limit violations from model providers
- Latency increases for your application
- Application changes that affect feedback scores reflecting end-user experience

Alerts in LangSmith are project-scoped, requiring separate configuration for each monitored project.

## Configuring an alert

### Step 1: Navigate To Create Alert

First navigate to the Tracing project that you would like to configure alerts for. Click **+ New Alert** in the top right hand corner of the page to set up an alert.

### Step 2: Select Metric Type

LangSmith offers threshold-based alerting on three core metrics:

| Metric Type        | Description                         | Use Case                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Errored Runs**   | Track runs with an error status     | Monitors for failures in an application.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Feedback Score** | Measures the average feedback score | Track [feedback from end users](/evaluation/how_to_guides/attach_user_feedback) or [online evaluation results](/evaluation/online_evaluations") to alert on regressions. |
| **Latency**        | Measures average run execution time | Tracks the latency of your application to alert on spikes and performance bottlenecks.                                                                                   |

Additionally, for **Errored Runs** and **Run Latency**, you can define filters to narrow down the runs that trigger alerts. For example, you might create an error alert filter for all `llm` runs tagged with `support_agent` that encounter a `RateLimitExceeded` error.

### Step 2: Define Alert Conditions

Alert conditions consist of several components:

- **Aggregation Method**: Average, Percentage, or Count
- **Comparison Operator**: `>=`, `<=`, or exceeds threshold
- **Threshold Value**: Numerical value triggering the alert
- **Aggregation Window**: Time period for metric calculation (currently choose between 5 or 15 minutes)
- **Feedback Key** (Feedback Score alerts only): Specific feedback metric to monitor

**Example:** The configuration shown above would generate an alert when more than 5% of runs within the past 5 minutes result in errors.

You can preview alert behavior over a historical time window to understand how many datapoints—and which ones—would have triggered an alert at a chosen threshold (indicated in red). For example, setting an average latency threshold of 60 seconds for a project lets you visualize potential alerts, as shown in the image below.

### Step 3: Configure Notification Channel

LangSmith supports the following notification channels:

1. [PagerDuty Integration](./alerts_pagerduty.mdx)
2. [Webhook Notifications](./alerts_webhook.mdx)

Select the appropriate channel to ensure notifications reach the responsible team members.

## Best Practices

- Adjust sensitivity based on application criticality
- Start with broader thresholds and refine based on observed patterns
- Ensure alert routing reaches appropriate on-call personnel
