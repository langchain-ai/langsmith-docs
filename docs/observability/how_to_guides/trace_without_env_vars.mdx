# Trace without setting environment variables

As mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:

- `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
- `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`
- `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`

In some environments, it is not possible to set environment variables. In these cases, you can set the tracing configuration programmatically.

:::caution Recently changed behavior
Due to a number of asks for finer-grained control of tracing using the `trace` context manager,
**we changed the behavior** of `with trace` to honor the `LANGSMITH_TRACING` environment variable in version **0.1.95** of the Python SDK. You can find more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.95).
The recommended way to disable/enable tracing without setting environment variables is to use the `with tracing_context` context manager, as shown in the example below.
