## How usage limits work

LangSmith lets you configure usage limits on tracing. Note that these are _usage_ limits, not _spend_ limits, which
mean they let you limit the quantity of occurrences of some event rather than the total amount you will spend.

LangSmith lets you set two different monthly limits, mirroring our Billable Metrics discussed in the aforementioned data retention guide:

- All traces limit
- Extended data retention traces limit

These let you limit the number of total traces, and extended data retention traces respectively.

## Properties of usage limiting

Usage limiting is approximate, meaning that we do not guarantee the exactness of the limit. In rare cases, there
may be a small period of time where additional traces are processed above the limit threshold before usage limiting
begins to apply.

## Side effects of extended data retention traces limit

The extended data retention traces limit has side effects. If the limit is already reached, any feature that could
cause an auto-upgrade of tracing tiers becomes inaccessible. This is because an auto-upgrade of a trace would cause
another extended retention trace to be created, which in turn should not be allowed by the limit. Therefore, you can
no longer:

1. match run rules
2. add feedback to traces
3. add runs to annotation queues

Each of these features may cause an auto upgrade, so we shut them off when the limit is reached.

## Updating usage limits

Usage limits can be updated from the `Settings` page under `Usage and Billing`. Limit values are cached, so it
may take a minute or two before the new limits apply.
